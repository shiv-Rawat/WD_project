<p>The original incarnation of Goku in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> prototype <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Boy" title="Dragon Boy">Dragon Boy</a></i> was <b><a href="/wiki/Tangtong" title="Tangtong">Tangtong</a></b>. The original inspirations for that story were <span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_action_cinema">Hong Kong martial arts films</a></span>, including <span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee">Bruce Lee</a></span> films such as <i><span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enter_the_Dragon">Enter the Dragon</a></span></i> (1973) and <span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Chan">Jackie Chan</a></span> films such as <i><span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunken_Master">Drunken Master</a></span></i> (1978);<sup id="cite_ref-Guide_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guide-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> Toriyama later said he had a young Jackie Chan in mind for a live-action Goku, stating that "nobody could play Goku but him."<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The <i>Dragon Ball</i> universe began as a loose adaptation of the classic Chinese novel <i>Journey to the West</i>, with Goku himself as an alternate take on <span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong">Sun Wukong</a></span>.

<p>When Toriyama started his first draft of <i>Dragon Ball</i>, he originally planned on making Goku full <a href="/wiki/Monkey" class="mw-redirect" title="Monkey">monkey</a> to make the series more faithful to <i><a href="/wiki/Journey_to_the_West" title="Journey to the West">Journey to the West</a></i>. During Toriyama's second draft, Goku was instead a full human dressed in sailor clothes that rode a flight mecha instead of the Flying Nimbus.<sup id="cite_ref-Daiz2_26-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Daiz2-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Toriyama's third draft became the final design.
</p><p>Goku's full name is also based on Sun Wukong. The name "Son Goku" is simply the Japanese on'yomi rendering of Sun Wukong, as Chinese and Japanese share the same characters but with different pronunciations. "Sun/Son" is a common Chinese surname that normally means "grandchild", while "Wukong/Goku" is a common Buddhist name that means "perceiving air/awakened to emptiness". Reading "Sun Wukong" via the first and final characters only through the Japanese kun'yomi rendering system makes it read out as "Mago Gosora", used at some point as a gag in the original manga's run by the <a href="/wiki/World_Tournament_Announcer" title="World Tournament Announcer">World Tournament Announcer</a>.
</p><p>Goku was revealed a month before the <i>Dragon Ball</i> manga started, in postcards sent to members of the Akira Toriyama Preservation Society.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Goku's first appearance was on the last page of "Grand Finale", the last chapter of the <i>Dr. Slump</i> manga, advertising <i>Dragon Ball's</i> upcoming debut.
</p><p>Goku's Saiyan birth name, Kakarot, <a href="/wiki/Origins_of_character_names" title="Origins of character names">is a pun on "carrot"</a>. <a href="/wiki/Son_family" title="Son family">Goku's family</a>, like most Saiyans, are all named after root vegetables (burdock, leek, radish, and carrot) or even the word "vegetable" itself.
</p><p>While Goku is an overall good person, <a href="/wiki/Akira_Toriyama" title="Akira Toriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> designed him as one who fights mostly for personal joy of challenging strong opponents. To which, Toriyama notes that the anime tends to go overboard in making Goku look heroic, and that his original depiction of Goku in the manga has certain "poisonous" traits.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The primary reason why Akira Toriyama created his <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan" title="Super Saiyan">Super Saiyan</a> state with blond hair was so that his assistant would no longer have to spend so much time coloring Goku's hair black - thus saving time. Due to also having the effect of making Goku appear stronger, it killed two birds with one stone.<sup id="cite_ref-SEG_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SEG-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Goku's Super Saiyan form was heavily influenced by the martial artist Bruce Lee. According to Toriyama, Goku's piercing eyes were based on Lee's paralyzing glare.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> <i>Dragon Ball Z</i> anime character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro also used Lee as a reference for Goku's Super Saiyan form, stating that, when he "first becomes a Super Saiyan, his slanting pose with that scowling look in his eyes is all Bruce Lee."<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Goku looks almost exactly like <a href="/wiki/Bardock" title="Bardock">his father</a>, possessing the same spiky black hairstyle, dark-colored eyes, and facial features. However, he has softer eyes, a kind demeanor, and a lighter-pale skin complexion from <a href="/wiki/Gine" title="Gine">his mother</a>. Goku's most distinguishing physical characteristic is his hair. He has three bangs hanging to the right of his forehead and two bangs hanging to the left. His hair also stands up in the front with four spikes and three bangs in the back (later in the anime, he has five spikes in the front and four in the back). Goku was born with the signature tail of the <a href="/wiki/Universe_7" title="Universe 7">Universe 7</a> Saiyans, which was long and prehensile with brown fur. It was removed and regrown multiple times in his early childhood, but in his late teens, Goku's tail was permanently removed by <a href="/wiki/Kami" title="Kami">Kami</a> in order to prevent his <a href="/wiki/Great_Ape" title="Great Ape">Great Ape</a> transformation.
</p><p>At age 12, Goku was rather short and appeared even younger than he was, being considered less than 10 years old (people were surprised when learning his actual age). His somewhat simple-minded personality also gave people the impression that he was as young as he looked. During the next few years, Goku did not go through any physical changes, other than his muscles becoming more pronounced. By age 15, he began showing noticeable increases in height. By age 18, he had a considerable growth spurt, growing taller than most of his friends and developing a well-built physique. He is also considered very handsome, as noted by various women including <a href="/wiki/Bulma" title="Bulma">Bulma</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heles" title="Heles">Heles</a>. His physical changes made him almost indistinguishable from before and was only recognized by his signature naïve personality and "trademark" hairstyle. By age 25, Goku had another growth spurt, and became similar in height to his taller human allies and much more muscular.
</p><p>Due to his love of training, he is most commonly seen wearing a <a href="/wiki/Gi" title="Gi">Gi</a>. Originally, Goku wore an open blue gi secured with a white bow-tied obi over his waist, red wristbands, and dark blue kung fu shoes and also a tank top. After training under <a href="/wiki/Master_Roshi" title="Master Roshi">Master Roshi</a>, Goku wore the basic <a href="/wiki/Turtle_School_Uniform" title="Turtle School Uniform">Turtle School Uniform</a>; consisting of a closed red gi (later orange) secured by a black knot-tied obi over his waist, blue wristbands, and blue kung fu shoes, with Roshi's <a href="/wiki/List_of_symbols" title="List of symbols">kanji</a> on the back and front-left side of his shirt. After training with Kami and <a href="/wiki/Mr._Popo" title="Mr. Popo">Mr. Popo</a>, Goku wore a black short-sleeved undershirt (later dark blue) with this gi and replaced his shoes with dark blue boots with a yellow border and red laces. After training under <a href="/wiki/King_Kai" title="King Kai">King Kai</a>, Goku wore King Kai's kanji on the back of his gi shirt. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_on_Planet_Namek" title="Battle on Planet Namek">Battle on Planet Namek</a>, Goku wore his own kanji on both sides of his gi shirt. During the <a href="/wiki/Android_conflict" title="Android conflict">Android conflict</a> and <a href="/wiki/Majin_Buu_conflict" class="mw-redirect" title="Majin Buu conflict">Majin Buu conflict</a>, Goku wore a more plain version of this gi that lacked any kanji and featured a blue sash-style obi over his waist, as well as the same dark blue undershirt, same wristbands and the same boots from his previous gi, but with a red border and yellow/tan laces. He later retains this outfit throughout most of <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super_(anime)" title="Dragon Ball Super (anime)">Dragon Ball Super</a></i> as he regains his own kanji on both sides of his gi shirt.
</p><p>During his early training under <a href="/wiki/Whis" title="Whis">Whis</a>, Goku wore an orange traditional and loose gi, with Whis' kanji on the front-left of his shirt, that was secured together with a blue obi tied in a knot at the left of his waist. He also wore blue wristbands that cover nearly his entire forearms and blue boots that clasp together on the front of his shins.
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super:_Broly" title="Dragon Ball Super: Broly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></i>, Goku returns to wearing a knot-style obi with his regular uniform and "Go" kanji (essentially regaining his <a href="/wiki/Frieza_Saga" title="Frieza Saga">Frieza Saga</a> appearance). In addition, to compensate for the wintery climate he is on, he also wears a long blue snow jacket with a high turtleneck, white stripes down his shoulders and arms and bold purple letters of "SAB" over the front-left side of it. It also has black gloves. In the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Patrol_Prisoner_Saga" title="Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga">Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga</a>, Goku is given the emblem of the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Patrol" title="Galactic Patrol">Galactic Patrol</a> in place of his own on the front of his uniform and also switches back to wearing a sash-style obi. In the <a href="/wiki/Granolah_the_Survivor_Saga" title="Granolah the Survivor Saga">Granolah the Survivor Saga</a>, Goku regains Whis' kanji on his standard gi when the angel trains him in honing <a href="/wiki/Autonomous_Ultra_Instinct_(ability)" title="Autonomous Ultra Instinct (ability)">Ultra Instinct</a>.

<p>When he appears in the <a href="/wiki/Prison_Planet_Saga" title="Prison Planet Saga">Prison Planet Saga</a>, Goku wears an outfit identical to the one Whis gave him, but instead with a <a href="/wiki/Capsule_Corporation" title="Capsule Corporation">Capsule Corp</a> logo. He also wears his blue shirt underneath the gi. In the <a href="/wiki/Universal_Conflict_Saga" title="Universal Conflict Saga">Universal Conflict Saga</a>, he wears an outfit identical to the Grand Minister's. The attire consists of a dark blue long-sleeved shirt with an orange circle over the chest, with baggy shoulder pads that runs beneath his red-colored belt with his kanji on the round belt-buckle. The shirt is complimented by a matching color pair of jodhpur-like pants, and white boots that run beneath his shins.
</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/Universe_Creation_Saga" title="Universe Creation Saga">Universe Creation Saga</a>, Goku's attire is the same from the previous arc but this time, it has a lighter tone of orange and the blue undershirt, tied-belt, wristbands and boots are now replaced  with a lighter black color. later on, in the <a href="/wiki/New_Space-Time_War_Saga" title="New Space-Time War Saga">New Space-Time War Saga</a>, after being released from the Demon's Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Goku returns with Vegeta with the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Empire" title="Dark Empire">Dark Empire</a>'s logo imprinted on his gi. 
</p><p>By the <a href="/wiki/World_Martial_Arts_Tournament#28th" title="World Martial Arts Tournament">28th World Martial Arts Tournament</a>, Goku wears a turquoise gi with a white knot-style obi, orange wristbands, dark green pants, and black kung fu shoes with orange stockings. In the cover of the <a href="/wiki/Goodbye,_Dragon_World" title="Goodbye, Dragon World">Goodbye, Dragon World</a> volume of the manga, this outfit's color is different. The gi is lime green, his wristbands are purple, his pants are cyan, and he wears the boots from his previous outfit, albeit purple. 
</p><p>Despite his fighting gi being his preferred look, Goku is not without other types of wardrobe, such as a suit and tie,<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> casual clothes like blue pants with a button-down red shirt, or an orange and black jacket with a white sleeveless undershirt, light green pants and brown shoes. When returning home to prepare for the androids, Goku wore a outfit similar to one from his youth; a white tank top with periwinkle Chinese pants with a white sash and purplish brown toe shoes and white socks. His farmer attire consists of light beige collared denim jacket with a white scarf around his neck and a charcoal gray short sleeved undershirt, light beige pants with a black belt around his waist and black boots. The sleeves on his jacket has been folded into white cuffs. 
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_GT" title="Dragon Ball GT">Dragon Ball GT</a></i>. Goku's skin tone got a noticeable tan. His general outfit is a blue gi with a white knot-style obi, pink wristbands, ochre pants, and black kung fu shoes with white stockings, which overall is very similar to his outfit at the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament. Due to the carelessness of <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Pilaf" title="Emperor Pilaf">Emperor Pilaf</a>, Goku was wished back into a 12-year-old. While essentially looking the same as he did back then, Goku showed considerably more defined muscle. Later, with the aid of <a href="/wiki/Old_Kai" title="Old Kai">Old Kai</a>, Goku regenerates his tail, which would poke out from his pants. 100 years later at the 64th World Martial Arts Tournament, despite growing back to his physical prime without transforming, he was not still seen with his tail. However, in one ending, he is seen with a tail in adult form. During which, he wears the outfit from the 28th Martial Arts Tournament. He also wears his <a href="/wiki/Power_Pole" title="Power Pole">Power Pole</a> again.
</p><p>When re-grown up, <i>GT</i> Goku appears in <a href="/wiki/Adventure_Mode_(Extreme_But%C5%8Dden)" title="Adventure Mode (Extreme Butōden)">the Adventure Mode of <i>Extreme Butōden</i></a>, he wears his classic outfit from <i>Dragon Ball Super</i>. In <i>Dragon Ball Minus</i>, an infant Goku was seen wearing a standard <a href="/wiki/Battle_Armor" title="Battle Armor">Battle Armor</a> of the Frieza Army when being sent to Earth. It is a full body model with a dark-colored chest protection and light-colored outward-pointing pads on his shoulders and at the hips that hang over his upper legs. He also wore dark jumpsuit shorts and light boots with dark legging and also dark armguards.

<p>Originally as an infant Saiyan, Goku was very timid, constantly crying for attention. Goku was then programmed with intense hostility to carry out his mission of eradicating all sentient life on Earth. When found by Grandpa Gohan, he was unruly, savage, and aggressive, wanting nothing to do with the elder, although this was seemingly only when worked up, as when initially found by Gohan, he quickly took a liking to the old man. However, after the head injury that caused him to lose his instinctual aggression, Goku became well-known for the energetic, kindhearted, pure heart and caring personality traits he inherited from his mother <a href="/wiki/Gine" title="Gine">Gine</a>. He was taught to be respectful to others by Grandpa Gohan. He takes most situations in stride, he rarely lets things get him worked up; he quickly got over losing his tail each time. He is however not without fear. Goku is shown to be submissive to overbearing women like Bulma and <a href="/wiki/Chi-Chi" title="Chi-Chi">Chi-Chi</a>, even to the point of Master Roshi jokingly declaring that for all his universal-class might, he is terrified of his wife. In the anime, he also has aichmophobia; a crippling fear of needles. He is not beyond feeling sorrow, most noticeably seen from the loss of his grandfather. He is not above feeling shame, as he regrets his lack of maturity as a person despite all the teachers who have helped him and likewise wants to make his loved-ones proud of him. He also shows genuine concern for the well-being of those close to him. When Master Roshi seemingly died against <a href="/wiki/Ganos" title="Ganos">Ganos</a>, Goku frantically rushed to his aid, desperate to save his mentor and shed tears of joy when he managed to revive him.
</p><p>He is well-noted for his love of any food, even by Saiyan standards,<sup id="cite_ref-SEG_4-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SEG-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> which can be comical at times. When hypnotized while facing "<a href="/wiki/Master_Roshi" title="Master Roshi">Jackie Chun</a>", Bulma told Goku dinner was ready, instantly waking him up.<sup id="cite_ref-DB27_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DB27-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> Like most Saiyans, Goku loves combat and to challenge strong opponents. As such, Goku rarely shows nervousness or fear when fighting. While not arrogant in his abilities (especially compared to <a href="/wiki/Vegeta" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a>), Goku has a tendency to be too relaxed and recklessly challenge anyone he views as strong to a fight. Despite his fighting spirit, he is, at heart, a pacifist, as he often spares his enemies, trying to avoid hurting or even killing people if possible and never using more strength than necessary.<sup id="cite_ref-DB64_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DB64-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-DBZ280_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DBZ280-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> He also strongly believes that people can change for the better, as he spared Piccolo, as well as Vegeta, in their respective fights, despite the former wanting to kill him and the latter killing most of Goku's allies. This, combined with his naturally gentle nature, can lead to him letting his guard down.
</p><p>Goku is <a href="/wiki/Heart_Purity" title="Heart Purity">pure of heart</a>, possessing no negative feelings or thoughts. He is highly loyal to his friends and family, even willing to sacrifice himself to save others as he did against <a href="/wiki/Raditz" title="Raditz">Raditz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cell" title="Cell">Cell</a>. He strongly believes in repaying debts, as he gave the then-evil Vegeta a <a href="/wiki/Senzu_Bean" title="Senzu Bean">Senzu Bean</a> for technically saving Gohan and Krillin from the <a href="/wiki/Ginyu_Force" title="Ginyu Force">Ginyu Force</a>. He is a man of his word, committed to keeping his promise no matter what; 2 prime examples being the resurrection of <a href="/wiki/Bora" title="Bora">Bora</a> and giving <a href="/wiki/Zeno" title="Zeno">the Omni-King</a> <a href="/wiki/Future_Zeno" title="Future Zeno">a friend</a> even more fun than himself. He has a very practical and carefree view of life and his goals are very simple; he only seeks new adventures and challenges like testing his limits as a warrior. He has no interest in luxury or high-ranking positions, as he rejected Kami's offer to become Guardian of Earth and, likewise, Whis' offer to become the next Universe 7th's God of Destruction, though the latter was mainly due to his morality making him unsuitable for it. At the same time, he shows such unwavering will and tenacity to succeed, always determined to never give up against any adversity.<sup id="cite_ref-DBZ280_35-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DBZ280-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Goku has been noted several times to have a special effect on people. His genuine compassion for others and love of life in its most simple nature is capable of inspiring them to change somewhat for the better, even causing several of his enemies to become his allies. He convinced the amoral and self-absorbed God of Destruction <a href="/wiki/Beerus" title="Beerus">Beerus</a> that Earth was worth keeping around. He made the reserved assassin <a href="/wiki/Hit" title="Hit">Hit</a> smile in genuine happiness, viewing Goku as an equal. He piqued the interest and became a friend of <a href="/wiki/Zeno" title="Zeno">Grand Zeno</a>, the most powerful being in the multiverse, due to his similar childlike, innocent personality. He made the immensely independent <a href="/wiki/Jiren" title="Jiren">Jiren</a> acknowledge Goku's view of companionship and sought to learn from Goku's example. He even made the spiteful and sadistically greedy <a href="/wiki/Frieza" title="Frieza">Frieza</a> come to truly respect Goku, despite his long-standing hatred of the Saiyan after their brief alliance. His passion to help people even inspired <a href="/wiki/Merus" title="Merus">Merus</a>, a Guiding Angel, to willingly violate Angel Law and directly engage against evil with his true divine powers, knowing the penalty of it.
</p><p>He has shown such innocence since childhood, mainly because of spending most of his childhood on <a href="/wiki/Mount_Paozu" title="Mount Paozu">Mount Paozu</a> in isolation, apart from the first few years of his life with his grandfather, and spending his adolescence traveling the world to sharpen his combat skills. This lack of social experience and proper education growing up (apart from the basic education from <a href="/wiki/Master_Roshi" title="Master Roshi">Master Roshi</a>) left him rather ignorant in many things outside of battle and had little development in emotional maturity. During his childhood, he originally had difficulty telling the difference between a male and a female without physically touching them, which often got him in trouble.<sup id="cite_ref-Bloomers_and_the_Monkey_King_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bloomers_and_the_Monkey_King-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>His lack of emotional maturity has also left him somewhat naïve, which often makes many incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid. His direct and carefree approach, combined with often taking things to face-value, acting very much on instinct most of the time, Goku can be very blunt as he expresses himself. Despite this, Goku is remarkably effective at applying himself once properly motivated, able to quickly comprehend the situation and likewise learn the basics of anything presented to him, if not master it. When taking a firsthand experience, Goku is shown to be incredibly perceptive and intuitive, quickly able to analyze the situation and formulate an effective countermeasure. Very methodical and tactical in his approach, he immediately saw through the limits of <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Second_Grade" title="Super Saiyan Second Grade">higher</a> <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Third_Grade" title="Super Saiyan Third Grade">grades</a> of Super Saiyan even without having tested them in battle and chose to instead refine his normal Super Saiyan form, impressing even his rival Vegeta at the crafty and innovative idea.
</p><p>He has a remarkable intuition to see the good in others in spite of their actions, though his compassion and willingness to forgive can have often been criticized as excessive even to a fault and has led to harm and death to those he cares about in extreme occasions. At the same time, for all his morally driven nature, Goku can show animosity towards those he believes have earned it, such as <a href="/wiki/Mercenary_Tao" title="Mercenary Tao">Mercenary Tao</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frieza" title="Frieza">Frieza</a> for killing <a href="/wiki/Bora" title="Bora">Bora</a> and <a href="/wiki/Krillin" title="Krillin">Krillin</a> respectively, a trait he seemed to inherit from his father <a href="/wiki/Bardock" title="Bardock">Bardock</a>. Overall, Goku only kills his enemies when he feels it is necessary or if they are beyond redemption. While viewed by many as a very honorable man of heroic nature, he openly never actually considers himself a savior, but rather simply refuses to let innocent people or animals get hurt, as his adoptive grandfather taught him. He openly prefers to reform enemies on the grounds that it will be more exciting to clash with them in the future that way. Ultimately, this is one of his greatest drives in life, constantly pushing him beyond his limits. Whenever his friends are threatened or harmed, Goku abandons nearly all mercy for the foe, as the mortal-wound to Piccolo and the loss of his best friend Krillin against <a href="/wiki/Frieza" title="Frieza">Frieza</a> allowed Goku to unleash <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan" title="Super Saiyan">Super Saiyan</a> on the tyrant. This is also seen when <a href="/wiki/Jiren" title="Jiren">Jiren</a> tried to kill all of Goku's friends, Goku fiercely attacked him with rage. However, his philosophy of turning enemies into allies has sometimes clouded Goku's discernment in recognizing that certain opponents of his are unable to change or have any change in his way of thinking, best exemplified by his final confrontation with <a href="/wiki/Moro" title="Moro">Moro</a>, where his attempts to try to make the warlock repent for his atrocities after dominating him not only allowed him to strengthen himself further and put the entire <a href="/wiki/North_Area" title="North Area">galaxy</a> at risk after the latter merged with Earth, which made Goku visibly desperate for realizing that his complacency ended up putting everything to lose.
</p><p>Another problem stemming from his lack of proper education, Goku had little understanding of adult responsibilities. As a result, he spent most of his marriage without a job, instead of being supported by his prize-winnings from the World Martial Arts Tournaments and the Ox-King's wealth. This limited education also was seen from his struggle in the written test for the <a href="/wiki/Tournament_of_Destroyers" title="Tournament of Destroyers">Tournament of Destroyers</a>. Overall, both his children have shown a better understanding of general matters as Chi-Chi ensured that Gohan and Goten had a well-educated background. While Chi-Chi later made Goku take up a job as a farmer, Goku is regularly shown with little interest in it, often looking for excuses to get out of work to train instead. This mostly stems from his Saiyan nature, instinctively desiring combative challenges.
</p><p>Goku has little modesty and is not at all concerned about public nudity (though later came to have a better appreciation for it). His simple nature rarely exhibits lustful feelings and thus little interest in women (with the exception of his wife). As a result, seduction tactics have no effect on him. While he is not normally reckless, he occasionally makes decisions without properly thinking them through, such as when he went to discuss the <a href="/wiki/Tournament_of_Power" title="Tournament of Power">Tournament of Power</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Zeno" title="Zeno">Omni</a>-<a href="/wiki/Future_Zeno" title="Future Zeno">Kings</a> despite Beerus warning him of the potential consequences of meeting with the amoral supreme rulers. While technically considerate in nature and never intentionally rude, Goku tends to not show proper respect to people of high authority; the most notable example being his casual interactions with the Omni-Kings and the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Minister" title="Grand Minister">Grand Minister</a> (even though they do not mind), much to the shock and disgust of numerous Gods and Kais. Goku can be insensitive at times, as shown by his willingness to promise <a href="/wiki/Old_Kai" title="Old Kai">Old Kai</a> naked photos of Bulma, without consideration for either Bulma or her husband Vegeta (though he rationalized it as for the sake of Earth's survival to enlist Old Kai's aid).

<p>He enjoys meeting new people and learning about/from them. Despite this and genuine compassion for others, Goku's ignorance at times comes off as a lack feeling familial ties but rather views his family simply as companions.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> He is rarely seen romantic or intimate with Chi-Chi and mainly married her because he promised, although once learning marriage means living with someone forever, openly liked the idea with Chi-Chi. He even cited her feistiness and passion as traits endearing to him. He will often leave his family for long periods, and though normally for noble reasons, such as maintaining his strength for the protection of the world, Goku does not realize its negative affect on his family and friends. Despite this, he consistently expresses his appreciation for his family, as after completing his training in the <a href="/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber" title="Hyperbolic Time Chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a> to face Cell, he chose to spend the remaining time with his family rather than training more. Goku desires for his children to follow in his footsteps as a fighter but he is generally accepting of their choices in lifestyle so long as they are happy and healthy. Overall, his love for his family has been a constant boost to his performance in battle. Also, Goku was very happy to learn he was going to be a grandfather, to which he later enjoyed taking care of his baby granddaughter <a href="/wiki/Pan" title="Pan">Pan</a> and grew very concerned when she disappeared. Against <a href="/wiki/Goku_Black" title="Goku Black">Goku Black</a>, when learning that the rogue god murdered his family in spite of their initial encounter, despite it only happening in the original timeline, Goku's <a href="/wiki/Now_I%27m_Mad!" title="Now I&#39;m Mad!">righteous rage</a> let him pummel Black and <a href="/wiki/Future_Zamasu" title="Future Zamasu">Future Zamasu</a> simultaneously.
</p><p>Goku's love for his adoptive grandfather has constantly been the most emotional and influential aspect of his life, even long after the old man's death, and as shown by Goku's reaction to each time they met again in Gohan's afterlife. Even after learning, they were not blood-related or even the same race, Goku still considers the old man his family, as shown by his great sorrow and shame when realizing that he killed the kind man as a Great Ape, apologizing deeply to him and hoping for forgiveness when next they meet. Goku's bond towards his grandfather made him cherish the Power Pole and the 4-Star Dragon Ball that he left his grandson behind as the only material objects of real worth to him. As a child, he even came to believe that the Dragon Ball housed the old man's spirit as he would speak it often, possibly as a coping mechanism to deal with his loss of his only known family. Goku was happy to meet all who were close to his grandfather and even delighted when his firstborn son reacted positively to being named after the elder.
</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Goku loves his family, supporting their goals as well as sacrificing himself twice to save Gohan and fighting off Zamsu when he found out Chi Chi and Goten had been killed by Goku Black’s. Despite this, he often leaves to fight or train. 
</p><p>While considering himself an Earthling more than Saiyan, in battle, he tends to think more like a typical Universe 7 Saiyan. Once a fight begins, he desires to see it through to the end to truly determine who is the winner. Even while battling Frieza on the self-destructing Planet Namek, he chose to finish his fight with Frieza even when offered the chance to escape through the Namekian Dragon Balls, believing that Frieza had to be defeated by his hand rather than random chance. He is also dissatisfied when foes do not use their full might. While valuing his friends' loyalty and willingness to accept help when the need comes, he prefers to face his challenges solo, determined to prove his might against the given foe. He openly showed dislike at originally acquiring <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God" title="Super Saiyan God">Super Saiyan God</a> through the aid of others rather than by his own merit. At the same time, he admits that the true growth of his being came from the support and connection he gained from others. His warrior mentality can be reckless at times. Against Cell, Goku chose to focus the majority of his efforts training Gohan in the goal of unlocking his son's dormant capacities to defeat Cell, forgetting that Gohan was even gentler than him. Likewise, for an unrestricted fight against Hit, Goku willingly risked his life by hiring Hit to kill him to fight him at his best. Goku is also willing to recruit help from his greatest of enemies like Frieza as he needed a strong tenth ally for the Tournament of Power though he himself acknowledged that it was a risky move and Vegeta noted that Goku wouldn't have done it under normal circumstances as the universes were at stake.
</p><p>At the same time, however, this ambition for the new generations stems from his humble concern that his friends and family have become too dependent on his might. He rationalizes his willingness to put the children in the spotlight of battle due to the fact that he will not always be around to help. He believes that the new generation needs to become stronger in order to protect the Earth from future threats. However, he is not without a personal goal behind it. Realizing the potential might of people like Gohan and <a href="/wiki/Uub" title="Uub">Uub</a>, he is excited by the idea of facing such might once realized. At the same time, Goku tries to keep people away from the battlefield if he feels it will be too dangerous for them as he during the battle against the resurrected Frieza, Goku ordering Goten and Trunks to leave the battlefield to avoid the tyrant's brutality with Vegeta and Bulma agreeing.

<p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Minus:_The_Departure_of_the_Fated_Child" title="Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child">Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child</a></i>, the three year old Kakarot is sent to Earth by his parents due to Bardock's keen intuition, suspecting that Frieza is planning to destroy the Saiyans due to his recent orders to return to Planet Vegeta and his men asking about legends regarding the Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan God. Upon reaching Earth, Kakarot encounters the Elder Gohan who after fighting with the child off panel brings him home where the Elder Gohan is able to placate the boy with food. The young Kakarot can be seen standing upon the table in Grandpa Gohan's House eating food with Grandpa Gohan commenting on his lack of manners as he refuses to sit in a nearby chair as he eats, before deciding to name the boy Son Goku (presumably due to Kakarot's either inability to speak or refusing to speak. While Kakarot/Goku behaves in a primitive manner and has no table manners, he is not as wild as Master Roshi's comments upon his early life with Grandpa Gohan, though it should be noted that the scene in <i>Dragon Ball Minus</i> is very brief and it doesn't contradict the original <i>Dragon Ball</i> manga as their is no accompanying flashbacks of the young Goku's childhood like in the anime (and Master Roshi was simply relaying second hand information he heard from Grandpa Gohan, stating that young pre-head injury Goku was wild and untamed child which fits with his depiction in <i>Dragon Ball Minus</i>). During the <a href="/wiki/Granolah_the_Survivor_Saga" title="Granolah the Survivor Saga">Granolah the Survivor Saga</a>, Goku finally learns about his father <a href="/wiki/Bardock" title="Bardock">Bardock</a> thanks to <a href="/wiki/Monaito" title="Monaito">Monaito</a> revealing how the low class Saiyan saved <a href="/wiki/Granolah" title="Granolah">Granolah</a> and Monaito during the Cereal Genocide and attempted to save Granolah's mother <a href="/wiki/Muezli" title="Muezli">Muezli</a> though she was unfortunately murdered by the <a href="/wiki/Heeter" title="Heeter">Heeter</a> <a href="/wiki/Elec" title="Elec">Elec</a>. Vegeta confirms Bardock is the name of Goku's (and by extension Raditz's) biological father and after hearing the story notes that from his perspective, Goku seemed to have inherited his soft heartedness from his parents, given it was Bardock's love for his wife and youngest son that caused him to rescue Granolah and his mother instead of exterminating them like he was supposed to as a <a href="/wiki/Saiyan_Army" title="Saiyan Army">Saiyan Army</a> soldier. It is also revealed that Bardock fought and defeated the Heeter <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">Gas</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Heeter%27s_transformation" title="Heeter&#39;s transformation">Transformed state</a> which he managed to defeat. Gas himself also lamented that Goku lacks his father's grit and determination which Gas apparently respected.

<p>Goku had very little knowledge of his biological family since he was too young to remember his parents and have never learned the good traits of them. His opinion on his Saiyan heritage kept varying through the course of <i>Z</i>. Furthermore, when Goku first discovered his Saiyan heritage, he rejected it out of horror and disgust at being from a race of vicious killers, though he started to embrace his heritage after Vegeta's speech against Frieza on Namek had inspired him to avenge the loss of all those killed by Frieza, including his Saiyan race. After his first time transforming into a <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan" title="Super Saiyan">Super Saiyan</a>, Goku seemed to have ultimately embraced his Saiyan heritage, while proclaiming himself to be the "Super Saiyan of legend" from the ancient Saiyan myths in order to frighten Frieza. Despite this, Goku has preferred to go by his Earthling name, although he has made Vegeta and later Broly sole exceptions because he knew that Vegeta will never change his mind on that, and also because the two are Saiyans like him. By <i>Broly</i>, Goku has embraced his Saiyan heritage enough that he was willing to tell Broly his Saiyan name and requested that Broly refer to him as it. During the Granola Saga, upon learning about the noble side of his father, Goku became noticealy more intrigued to hear about him. Upon hearing a recording of Bardock's voice, Goku began to remember more about his parents and how they loved him so much to risk their lives to save him. In <i>Xenoverse 2</i>, despite his extreme hatred for his evil brother, he showed an interest in learning more about his parents. When learning that the <a href="/wiki/Future_Warrior_(Xenoverse_2)" title="Future Warrior (Xenoverse 2)">Future Warrior</a> is training under his father, Goku showed an interest in meeting him, even bringing his family.
</p><p>Goku's most unique relationship is with the Saiyan prince Vegeta. Their rivalry is mostly one-sided as Goku is generally friendly towards Vegeta and recognizes his abilities as a fighter, although Goku does get competitive with Vegeta as seen from learning that Vegeta left without him to train under Whis. While Goku and Vegeta have trouble working together, due to their conflicting personalities and Vegeta's continued desire to best Goku, they both respect and motivate each other to grow stronger, ultimately becoming close and loyal friends outside their competitive nature. Also, Goku is not above teasing him and tends to admonish Vegeta's brutality towards enemies as shown when he criticizes Vegeta for killing the Ginyu Force, though this was mainly due to Vegeta killing incapacitated opponents.
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Kakarot" title="Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</a></i>, during the wait for the <a href="/wiki/Cell_Games" title="Cell Games">Cell Games</a> after finding out Gohan is staying over at Capsule Corporation after helping the repaired Android 16, Chi-Chi notes that since Bulma is loaded she bets he is enjoying quite the spread of food and asks Goku if he's jealous. Goku's response is that while he loves good grub, to him  nothing tastes as good as her home cooked meals, causing Chi-Chi to feel both flattered and slightly embarrassed. This shows that he does indeed appreciate all the work she puts in cooking his meals.

<p>Goku was named Kakarot at birth by his father Bardock. In the manga, Kakarot was born on Planet Vegeta three years before its destruction, while in the anime he was born shortly before the destruction of the planet. When Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, Kakarot survived as he was being sent to Earth on a routine infiltration mission to destroy all life on the planet in order to sell it. After landing on Earth, the young Saiyan was found in the woods by an old man named <a href="/wiki/Grandpa_Gohan" title="Grandpa Gohan">Gohan</a> and became his adopted grandson. Grandpa Gohan names him "Son Goku".

Bardock makes the decision to send Kakarot away to Earth in an <a href="/wiki/Attack_Ball" title="Attack Ball">Attack Ball</a> since he is worried about Frieza's ambitions. Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta a month after Kakarot has been sent away.
</p><p>Days later after being sent to Earth, Kakarot lands in <a href="/wiki/Mount_Paozu" title="Mount Paozu">Mount Paozu</a>. While there, he is found by an elderly man, <a href="/wiki/Grandpa_Gohan" title="Grandpa Gohan">Gohan</a>. He takes him in and feeds the newly found alien. Kakarot is eating when he is given the name "Son Goku". While Kakarot seems somewhat placated by the food, Grandpa Gohan notes his lack of manners as he stands upon the table to eat rather than sit in the nearby empty chair. It is also implied by Grandpa Gohan's statements that the two briefly fought when they first met, though Grandpa Gohan was apparently able to prevail, due to him being a more experienced martial artist than the young low class Saiyan.

<p>At first, Goku was extremely violent and ill-tempered, not obeying Gohan at all, but one day he fell down a deep ravine and hit his head, suffering severe head trauma that sent him into a coma and very nearly killed him and caused him to suffer long-term amnesia. After he woke up, he had lost all of his Saiyan aggression due to not remembering his mission, becoming a kind and mild-mannered young boy.<sup id="cite_ref-Reunions_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Reunions-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> His Grandpa Gohan taught him martial arts and told him about such things as the city and people, as they lived in a very remote place in <a href="/wiki/Mount_Paozu" title="Mount Paozu">Mount Paozu</a>, with no communication with other people.

<p>Gohan one day discovered Goku's full moon transformation, and thus told him to never look at the full moon. However, one night Goku did, and he transformed into a Great Ape, causing him to unknowingly kill Gohan. After his grandpa's death, Goku stayed at his home, carrying out his daily life of survival. From a young age, Goku developed a prediction that his birth parents abandoned him in the mountains as a baby, leaving him for Grandpa Gohan to discover.<sup id="cite_ref-No_Balls.21_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-No_Balls.21-39">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>

Goku and Tien seem to be even, until Goku removes his <a href="/wiki/Weighted_clothing" class="mw-redirect" title="Weighted clothing">weighted clothing</a> and becomes much faster, winning the match and leaving him against Piccolo Jr. in the final round.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">&#91;113&#93;</a></sup> Before the fight started, Piccolo had trapped Kami inside a bottle with the <a href="/wiki/Evil_Containment_Wave" title="Evil Containment Wave">Evil Containment Wave</a> technique and ate the bottle, putting Goku at a stalemate; if he kills Piccolo, Kami will die too. The fight goes on for a while, but when the word spreads that Piccolo Jr. is the son of King Piccolo, the crowd flees. Goku encourages Piccolo Jr. to transform into his <a href="/wiki/Great_Namekian" title="Great Namekian">Giant form</a>, tricking him to fly into his mouth to retrieve the bottle Kami was in. Afterward, the stage is destroyed as they go into full battle. Goku seems to be doing quite well against Piccolo, using the <a href="/wiki/Meteor_Combination" title="Meteor Combination">Meteor Combination</a> rush, seemingly knocking him out, but Piccolo <a href="/wiki/Mouth_Energy_Wave" title="Mouth Energy Wave">blasts a hole in Goku's shoulder</a>, seriously handicapping him. Piccolo then makes sure Goku has no arms or legs to use, saying he will not make the same mistake his father did, letting Goku have one free arm to kill him with in the end. As Goku is about to die, he discovers how to fly and uses that energy to avoid one of Piccolo's attacks. He then finishes Piccolo off with the last amount of energy he has left with a full force headbutt to the chest giving Piccolo a ring out, thus giving Goku his first and only Tournament win. After Goku is declared victor, he gives Piccolo Jr. a <a href="/wiki/Senzu_Bean" title="Senzu Bean">Senzu Bean</a> to keep Kami alive and give himself a good rival.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">&#91;114&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In the beginning of <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z" title="Dragon Ball Z">Dragon Ball Z</a></i>, Goku is 24 years old and is still living at Mount Paozu in a newly-built house near his <a href="/wiki/Goku%27s_House" title="Goku&#39;s House">old house</a>, with his wife Chi-Chi and their four-year-old son, <a href="/wiki/Gohan" title="Gohan">Gohan</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">&#91;118&#93;</a></sup> After saving Gohan from falling down a waterfall, Goku drops by the Kame House with his son, to introduce him to Bulma, Master Roshi, and Krillin. All seems to be well, but suddenly, Goku senses a huge power nearby. The new threat arrives from space; <a href="/wiki/Raditz" title="Raditz">Raditz</a>, Goku's older brother. Raditz reveals to Goku his <a href="/wiki/Saiyan" title="Saiyan">Saiyan</a> heritage, and informs him that he was originally sent to Earth to destroy the planet's inhabitants and prepare it to be sold, but had forgotten about it due to his head injury as a baby.<sup id="cite_ref-Reunions_38-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Reunions-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> When Goku refuses to carry out his forgotten mission, Raditz delivers a single kick to Goku's ribs, knocking him down, and kidnaps Gohan, giving Goku an ultimatum: Raditz will kill Gohan unless Goku kills one hundred humans within the next twenty-four hours, and leaves them on the beach.
</p><p>To defeat Raditz and save the Earth, Krillin and Master Roshi offer to help, but Goku does not accept their request, due to the fact that if they die again, they cannot be brought back, since they have already been killed. Piccolo, who had been listening to Raditz's speech while hiding behind the Kame House, asks Goku to help him fight this new being, so they join forces.<sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">&#91;119&#93;</a></sup> When Piccolo and Goku find Raditz with Gohan locked up in his spacepod, Goku gives Raditz one last chance to free his son, but Raditz refuses.

<p>Knowing he will have to battle the more powerful Vegeta, Goku requests the move to an isolated location and Vegeta agrees. Before battling, Vegeta tries convincing Goku to join him but Goku refuses because he is content on Earth. As the battle unfolds, they seem even. Vegeta gains the upper hand with even the <a href="/wiki/Kaio-ken" title="Kaio-ken">Kaio-ken</a> not working. Goku, in a desperate attempt, powers up to Kaio-ken times three, and overpowers Vegeta, causing Vegeta to go in a rage and attempt to destroy the planet with a <a href="/wiki/Galick_Gun" title="Galick Gun">Galick Gun</a>. Goku's <a href="/wiki/Kaio-ken_Kamehameha" title="Kaio-ken Kamehameha">Kaio-ken Kamehameha</a> and Vegeta's Galick Gun blasts collide, and Goku beats Vegeta in the <a href="/wiki/Beam_Struggle" class="mw-redirect" title="Beam Struggle">Beam Struggle</a> by going Kaio-ken times four, however, causing his body great pain. When Vegeta returns, he transforms into a Great Ape using a <a href="/wiki/Power_Ball" title="Power Ball">Power Ball</a>, and Goku realizes he is the one who killed his grandfather, and apologizes for it, hoping for forgiveness.

<p>After ordering Gohan to escape Namek with Piccolo and Bulma, Goku battles Frieza again and, at first, easily outmatches him with his newfound power. Goku then taunts Frieza into going to 100%, saying how due to the damage sustained in his 70% form, he won't be able to hold onto his full power for long. After Frieza attempts to destroy Namek, Frieza finally goes to 100% power. At first, it seems that Frieza has outmatched Goku, but then Frieza is shocked to hear that Goku was holding back and was relieved that that wasn't his full power. As time goes on, Frieza begins to lose his stamina and his power level drops like a stone. Goku then states he no longer wishes to fight Frieza because he says it is pointless. Goku then flies off and lets the space tyrant go. In desperation and frustration, Frieza uses his <a href="/wiki/Death_Saucer" title="Death Saucer">Death Saucer</a> attack, creating two pink <a href="/wiki/Destructo_Disc" title="Destructo Disc">Destructo Discs</a> and throwing them at Goku. Goku moves too quickly for the attack and maneuvers himself so that Frieza is in between him and the disks. Goku yells a warning to Frieza, but Frieza is too slow and is cut in half, losing an arm in addition to his legs. The weak tyrant begs Goku to help him. Goku, believing that Frieza does not deserve to be forgiven or spared, gives him some of his energy as a show of mercy. Bitter at his defeat, Frieza uses it to launch <a href="/wiki/You_Will_Die_By_My_Hand!" class="mw-redirect" title="You Will Die By My Hand!">a powerful energy wave</a> at Goku.

Although they are evenly matched at Super Saiyan 2, Goku is not surprised Vegeta has pushed his limits in training over the past seven years. However Goku is horrified when Vegeta admits he allowed Babidi to take control of him so he can reawaken the evil in him and defeat Goku, who condemns Vegeta for using this as an excuse for betraying his family.

The battle between Goku and Vegeta abruptly ends when Goku senses that Majin Buu has been released and pleads with Vegeta to help him defeat Majin Buu. Vegeta refuses to listen, even when told Majin Buu will kill his family, but Goku punches him down for bluffing. In a false show of agreement, Vegeta knocks Goku out from behind while he is getting a Senzu Bean out of a bag. Vegeta then eats the only Senzu Bean left and flies off to face Majin Buu alone.

As Gotenks is about to finish Super Buu after a lengthy battle, he reverts to his base form and quickly defuses. Gohan (after having his hidden power released) then arrives, effortlessly thrashing Buu with his newfound powers, but Super Buu escapes by self-destructing until Goten and Trunks can fuse again an hour later, and he then absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo, gaining the upper hand. When Gohan fails due to Super Buu's stolen powers, Old Kai gives his life to Goku so that he may return to Earth to help Gohan.

When Goku arrives on the battlefield, much to the surprise of Gohan and Super Buu, he cuts Super Buu in half with a Destructo Disc and tosses one of the earrings to Gohan. Gohan misses for the grab, and Goku tells Gohan to hurry and find the earring. He stalls Super Buu, fighting as a Super Saiyan 3. After the fight, Gotenks defuses inside Super Buu, and his power drops to almost 1/3 of his original power. Goku states that he is not much of a threat anymore and realizes that they can beat Super Buu easily. However, Gohan is absorbed when Super Buu catches him off-guard. At this moment of despair, the newly resurrected Vegeta appears and Goku asks him to fuse with him. Vegeta refuses and the two briefly battle Super Buu but fail miserably. Goku then tells Vegeta that their families and friends have been killed and begs for Vegeta to put their differences aside so they can save the Earth.

<p>Vegeta finally agrees and the two of the most powerful remaining Saiyans fuse to become <a href="/wiki/Vegito" title="Vegito">Vegito</a>. Vegito then easily thrashes Super Buu, even with Gohan absorbed. Super Buu tries every technique and attack he has got against the fused Saiyans, but Vegito manages to dodge by all of them without much trouble. After a lengthy fight, the mighty Vegito wins easily. However, supposedly due to Vegeta's arrogance in not simply finishing Buu off, Vegito is eventually absorbed by Super Buu, with a <a href="/wiki/Saiyan_Shield" class="mw-redirect" title="Saiyan Shield">Saiyan Shield</a> protecting him. However, it is later revealed that he chose to be absorbed on purpose because he wanted to rescue his friends and family before killing Super Buu.

<p>Outside, Goku rescues Mr. Satan, his dog <a href="/wiki/Bee" title="Bee">Bee</a>, and Dende, but fails in saving Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo before the newly transformed Kid Buu destroys the Earth in an extreme show of power (Vegeta previously stopped him from doing this with a much smaller blast that could still take out the planet, but he then charged a huge ball they could not deflect in response). <a href="/wiki/Kibito_Kai" title="Kibito Kai">Kibito Kai</a> <a href="/wiki/Kai_Kai" title="Kai Kai">teleports</a> in and saves Vegeta, Goku, Dende, and Mr. Satan by bringing them to the Sacred World of the Kai.

</p><p>When Kid Buu finds them, Vegeta and Goku have a <a href="/wiki/Rock-Paper-Scissors" title="Rock-Paper-Scissors">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a> match to see who fights first. Goku wins and fights Buu. In the Anime, he starts the fight as a Super Saiyan 2, but eventually transforms into Super Saiyan 3. When he is a Super Saiyan 3, he fights evenly with Kid Buu for a short time, taking the advantage often. However, Goku had failed to account for the strain that fighting in a living body would have on him, and soon becomes exhausted. He attempts to gather up his strength while Vegeta distracts Buu in his Super Saiyan 2 form (getting mercilessly beaten in the process), but his Super Saiyan 3 transformation drains him of his energy reserves and he soon loses the ability to maintain the form. At Vegeta's suggestion, Goku begins gathering energy for a <a href="/wiki/Super_Spirit_Bomb" title="Super Spirit Bomb">Super Spirit Bomb</a> that would employ all the available energies of the Earth and its occupants (he does this to have the Earth "save itself for once").

<p>Using King Kai's telepathy, Vegeta speaks to the newly revived people of Earth and begs for everyone to donate power to Goku's Spirit Bomb, which they are hesitant to do. Everyone on New Namek and the Other World gives energy for the Super Spirit Bomb and possibly many other planets as well, along with Goku's close friends. Meanwhile, Fat Majin Buu, while trying to hold off Kid Buu, falls in battle leaving a battered Vegeta to protect Goku while he forms the Super Spirit Bomb. Eventually, Mr. Satan finally convinces everyone on the newly regenerated Earth to give Goku all the energy he needs to destroy Kid Buu once and for all. With the contribution of power from Earth, Goku launches the Super Spirit Bomb. But as impossible as it seems, Kid Buu actually stops the Spirit Bomb and slowly begins to push it back at Goku. Vegeta realizes Goku used the rest of his power to gather and form the bomb and has nothing left to defeat Buu.

With his power restored, Goku powers up the Super Spirit Bomb even more, transforms into a Super Saiyan and stops Kid Buu's forward progress and the Super Spirit Bomb comes back to Kid Buu.

<p>Goku transforms into <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_3" title="Super Saiyan 3">Super Saiyan 3</a> and charges with full force, managing to get punches on Beerus. A Kamehameha wave was shot towards Beerus but was blocked by his finger. Goku began to feel intimidated by Beerus and attacks him once again. He notices his hits aren't landing and that Beerus let him get hits on him. A final Kamehameha misses Beerus and goes through King Kai's planet. Beerus has enough and promptly defeats Goku with ease before taking off for Earth. With Goku lying on the ground in agony, he remarks about the comments Beerus made about the Super Saiyan God. He still wants to fight Beerus and suggests fusion with Vegeta but still doesn't think that is enough.

<p>After an attempt to chop Goku's neck fails, they both agree to not use any "cheap tricks". Goku and Beerus charge their <i>ki</i> and rush towards each other to clash their fists. This clash leads to shock waves throughout the universe of which could destroy the planets, the stars, the universe, the gods, and themselves. Goku and Beerus continue to clash even though Goku is contacted by Kibito Kai to stop. Goku and Beerus clash one last time, however it is cancelled out as Goku used the same amount of power and attacked at the same angle as Beerus. The two continue to battle until Beerus throws an Atomic Bomb attack at Goku and he returns a Kamehameha. The collision of the blasts cause more shock waves and Goku continues to surpass his limits using the Super Saiyan God's powers.

Eventually Goku's Super Saiyan God form expires, due to having a time limit, but still possesses the power. Goku reverts into his Super Saiyan form, but still is able to gets hits on Beerus.
</p><p>In the manga, Goku stays in Super Saiyan God for the entire fight and the idea that Goku absorbs the power of the God form into his lesser forms is discarded. Beerus declares that he will not destroy Earth and informs Goku of the other universes as well as the fact that Whis is stronger than him, before leaving. However immediately after, Beerus suddenly returns to Goku to tell him that he's the second strongest fighter he's ever fought.<sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">&#91;177&#93;</a></sup>

Goku says that he and Vegeta are still below Beerus in power and are no match for him. Beerus suggests to send Goku and Vegeta to <a href="/wiki/Inside_Whis%27s_Staff" title="Inside Whis&#39;s Staff">"that place"</a> so they can train to get stronger quicker. While in there, Goku and Vegeta cannot move until Vegeta figures out that they shouldn't have their <i>ki</i> leaking out.

Whis finally see's Bulma's message about Frieza coming back but the time it'll take for Whis to get Vegeta and Goku to Earth will be 35 minutes so Goku uses <a href="/wiki/Instant_Transmission" title="Instant Transmission">Instant Transmission</a> to get to Earth but he can't sense anybody's <i>ki</i>.

<p>Goku and Frieza simultaneously walk towards each other and begin a power struggle. The power struggle eventually explodes and they continue fighting. Then, Frieza commences to pull dirty tricks on Krillin and Bulma. Goku saves Krillin the first time but when trying to save Bulma, Frieza lands a blow that sends Goku falling toward the ground. After colliding again, Goku warns Frieza about attacking the others and he's only fighting him. While Goku is fighting Frieza he gets kicked in the back by Vegeta.
</p><p>Goku and Vegeta begin fighting each other. Frieza breaks up their fight to ask Vegeta question his loyalty. Frieza wants to get his revenge on Goku so he wants Vegeta to wait a little longer. Goku and Frieza decide to reveal their true power to each other. Goku unleashes his new power, <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Blue" title="Super Saiyan Blue">Super Saiyan Blue</a> and Frieza questions if he just went Super Saiyan but Goku says that he's a Super Saiyan with the power of Super Saiyan God.
</p><p>Goku urges Frieza to show him his new power and after one more trick, Frieza transforms into <a href="/wiki/Golden_Frieza" title="Golden Frieza">Golden Frieza</a>. They restart the fight, firing <i>ki</i> blasts at each other until it leads to an energy clash between the two's energy beams that results in an explosion. After a seemingly even conflict, Frieza gains the upper hand and knocks Goku to the ground, leaving the Saiyan surprised with how Frieza caught up to his power like it was nothing. After Beerus' arrival, the two resume their duel once more with Frieza gaining the upper hand, leaving Goku exhausted and critically injured.

<p>Goku refuses to give up which leads to Frieza hurting him more until Goku bites his tail but once again the fight leads to him being knocked to the ground. Vegeta suggests switching places but Goku insists that he's "almost got him". Goku warns Frieza to leave before the tables turn due to his weakness before resuming the fight. It would seem that Frieza has finally won until Goku resists Frieza's finishing punch saying that he finally reached his limit and punches Frieza back hard. Goku explains Frieza's weakness: he came to Earth as soon as he unlocked his Golden form, therefore he is burning more stamina and power than his body can regulate and should have got used to it first before exacting his revenge.

Goku asks Vegeta if he wants to train in the Time Chamber but Vegeta says that they're close to their limits. Goku says he will train alone and become stronger quicker, which leads to Vegeta wanting to train with him also and they could go all-out because they're two of them. Goku asks Piccolo to train with him but he declines.
</p><p>While training in the <a href="/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber" title="Hyperbolic Time Chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a>, Goku wonders if the warriors from Universe 6 will be strong to which Vegeta tells him that they will be. Goku is excited to see them and even the fighter Beerus has been speaking of. Vegeta wants Goku to act his age but not knowing what he meant, Goku responds saying that Saiyans stay young until they reach the age of 80. Vegeta was, however, taking about his mentality. Goku and Vegeta turn into Super Saiyan Blue so they both could go all. They train for three years in the room (three days in the outside world).

<p>On the day of the tournament, Goku and Vegeta finish their training and emerge with beards. As Whis picks everyone up in his cube, Goku asks Videl where Gohan is, she says that he's in an important conference. Goku greets Monaka and questions his name, which means nipples. Later, everyone is playing Shiritori. When Whis says the phrase, "Juri-Juri", Goku questions a "Juri-Juri" so Whis responds saying that it's a bird from his planet.
</p><p>On the Nameless Planet, Goku is amazed after seeing the size of the Super Dragon Balls. Upon landing, he notices <a href="/wiki/Shin" title="Shin">Shin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kibito" title="Kibito">Kibito</a> and wonders why they're separate.

Goku and Vegeta are recognized by Cabba to be a Saiyan and he also reveals that he's a Saiyan, which surprises them. Goku asks Cabba where his tail is, to which Cabba explains their race had tails long ago, but lost them due to evolving.

<p>Goku takes the exam and barely passes with a fifty-percent however, their team is short a member because Buu failed his. Goku blames Vegeta for requesting such a thing. Goku takes the first match against <a href="/wiki/Botamo" title="Botamo">Botamo</a>. When the match begins Goku is immediately rushed by Botamo. Goku is struggling to dodge his attacks and eventually gets hit. Beerus is wondering what Goku is doing but Goku says he's just trying to exercise his meal off.
</p><p>Goku begins running in the ring while Botamo is trying to attack him but fails to connect. Botamo eventually is worn out so Goku takes advantage of this as he is done exercising his meal. Goku attacks Botamo but no one can see him move because he's moving at an immense speed. Goku begins to take control by attacking Botamo but he isn't taking any damage even after firing a Kamehameha at him. Goku thinks of an idea to beat Botamo and pushes him down and drags him to the edge of the ring. As Botamo tries to punch Goku, he grabs his arm and throws him out of the ring, resulting in a ring out.

As the <a href="/wiki/Referee" title="Referee">Referee</a> commences the match, Frost charges Goku and they both attack and block each other in rapid succession. Goku uppercuts Frost in the gut and kicks him to the floor. Goku assumes that Frost is trying to test his power though Frost denies it. Goku is eager to see Frost transform into his final form but Frost wonders how he knew he could transform. Goku tells Frost that he fought someone similar before and that he should transform so he wont't be defeated without using his true power. Frosts then transforms into his "final form".

<p>Goku is surprised at Frost's transformation and says he hasn't seen that form previously. Frost asks if his counterpart defeated Goku though he chooses not to say so Frost assumes that he didn't. Goku and Frost battle it out again until Frost fires a finger blast at Goku which sends him crashing to the ground. Goku immediately hops up, not taking serious damage. Goku still thinks Frost is hiding another transformation so he transforms into Super Saiyan. As Goku charges towards Frost, Frost transforms into his true final form. As a Super Saiyan, Goku completely outclassed Frost, with him unable to land a major blow. However Frost catches him with a glancing blow which instantly renders Goku dizzy and unable to fight, leading Frost to kick Goku out of the ring and win the match.

<p>Chi-Chi hurries to check on him. Goku admits his loss who suddenly congratulates Goku and raises his hand. He explains to Beerus that he thought Super Saiyan was enough for Frost and didn't think he needed to push him any further. Before Piccolo starts his match with Frost, Goku bluntly tells Piccolo that he's no match for Frost but he can damage him a little for Vegeta. After Frost is revealed to have cheated, Beerus locates a wound on Goku's hand from Frost's poison needle and is allowed to compete again. However, Beerus insists that Monaka will go last and Goku will go after Vegeta.

<p>After Vegeta loses to Hit, Goku, after figuring out Hit's abilities, enters the ring to fight Hit himself. After throwing himself at Hit a few times Goku manages to block one of Hit's moves, to which Hit thought was a fluke and attacked again with his Time Skip and this time Goku draws blood from Hit and begins to go on the attack, countering Hit's time skipping ability by predicting where he is going to be, much to the annoyance of Vegeta. Hit, realizing his Time-Skip is useless is forced to fight seriously and Goku goes Super Saiyan Blue and attacks Hit, forcing him to power up.

Goku notes the chances of him doing it is roughly 10% and failure will likely kill him. Goku explains that combining the Kaio-ken technique with his Super Saiyan Blue form is possible due to the form's required calm mind and perfect innate <i>ki</i> control, and he did not attempt to combine it with the previous Super Saiyan forms because they were too rough on his body and he would have died. Goku then powers it up ten times and goes on the assault, totally outclassing Hit but notes his body is starting to give out so Goku fires a Kamehameha at Hit. Hit however survives and the fight continues.

<p>Determined to prove to Champa that he and Hit are more than just "pawns", Goku prepares to attack Hit again, but Hit once again increased his Time-Skip and lands a strong barrage of punches on Goku. Goku retaliates with a strong blow, knocking Hit into part of the arena. Goku asks Beerus to remove the tournament rules, realizing that Hit is holding back because of the non-killing rule. Champa agrees, while Beerus disagrees, and they begin to argue. Wanting to fight Hit another time, Goku deliberately falls out of the ring and Hit is declared the winner. When Goku disperses the Kaio-ken technique, he recieves an immense amount of pain and collapses.

<p>In the manga, Goku is able to counter some of Hit's attacks while in his base form. Hit repeatedly scolds Goku for revealing his strategy. Goku is able to fight evenly with Hit in Super Saiyan but it becomes clear that he is expending stamina while Hit is not. When Goku enters Super Saiyan God, Hit's Time Skip becomes ineffective as the gap in their power becomes greater. Hit responds by going to full power, claiming he'll only need one minute and one Time Skip usage to win. Goku uses Super Saiyan Blue and its full power allows him to break through Hit's Time Skip and lands a kick followed by a massive Kamehameha that Hit dodges. He then surrenders as he does in the anime.
</p><p>In the anime, Beerus angrily confronts Goku, and admits that he would have lost anyway due to the Kaio-ken's time limit and reminds him that Monaka has not fought yet. Goku, not knowing that Monaka is an amateur, cheers him on, and when Monaka wins the match due to Hit deliberately being knocked out of the ring, Universe 7 is announced as the winner of the tournament.

<p>When <a href="/wiki/Zeno" title="Zeno">Zeno</a> appears and mentions that he would be interested in organizing another tournament, Goku casually tells him it would be fun, as Champa and Beerus are flustered. Goku and Zeno talk and Zeno praises Goku for his match with Hit. Goku extends his hand out to Zeno, causing both Gods of Destruction to worry. Zeno shakes his hand and calls Goku funny. Zeno then leaves, with Beerus and Champa sighing in relief, telling Goku that he can destroy all of the universes if he wished. Goku approaches Hit, wanting to have a rematch against him at a later time. After Beerus uses his the Super Dragon Balls to make his wish, the group arrive on Beerus' planet, Goku asks Beerus for a short sparring match with Monaka, but Beerus refuses, saying that as they are both tired from the tournament, they should go home and rest. Whis then drops off the Z-Fighters back on Earth.

Bulma hosts a party following Universe 7's victory, with Beerus, Whis and Monaka also invited. Goku meanwhile is seen taking a nap on a farm. After Beerus and Whis arrive, Beerus instructs everyone to keep Monaka being weak a secret from Goku, stating that if Goku finds out, he will lose any motivation to grow stronger. Goku teleports to the party and upon seeing Monaka tries to get him to fight him but Chi-Chi forces Goku to fly home to change into cleaner clothes. He does so, and teleports right back, wearing his regular Gi, still eager for a sparring match. In order to buy more time, Beerus forces Goku to do three hundred trillion sit-ups, which he does quickly, not knowing how to count that high.

<p>As Goku drags a frightened Monaka to a secure area to fight, Chiaotzu and Krillin attempt to slow Goku down, as Beerus dons a life-sized costume of Monaka made by Mr. Satan. Goku, fooled by the costume, engages in battle with Beerus. As they fight, the costume begins to rip, exposing his body parts. Vegeta and Piccolo intervene, claiming that "Monaka" has the ability to control people, but Beerus throws them away and starts fighting with Goku again, with Whis explaining that Beerus is enjoying the fight. Whis ends the fight when it begins to become too serious, not wanting them to destroy Earth. Goku is impressed by Monaka's power, as Yamcha nonchalantly comments that (the real) Monaka has passed out due to the fight, much to everyone's annoyance. After seeing the real Monaka, Goku praises "Monaka" for having the ability to <a href="/wiki/Cloning" title="Cloning">split himself</a>. Goku and an exhausted Beerus, then says they are ready to eat, and the party starts.

<p>One night, Goku surprises his family when he appears to not have much of an appetite. Goten and Chi-Chi wonder if Goku is sick, or dying, and Goku says he isn't. While Goku is grocery shopping his <i>Ki</i> has a mind of its own, not allowing Goku to turn back or even land properly. Goku visits King Kai on Chi-Chi's suggestion, but his <i>Ki</i> is interfering with his teleporting, and he lands in Bulma's bedroom, Krillin's police station, Penguin Village while seeing Arale, and on the top of Korin Tower. Goku finally teleports to King Kai's planet, as King Kai inspects him.
</p><p>King Kai then tells Goku that he is suffering from <a href="/wiki/Delayed_Onset_Ki_Disorder" title="Delayed Onset Ki Disorder">Delayed Onset Ki Disorder</a>, which temporarily disrupts a person's <i>Ki</i> after they use it in a reckless manner. In Goku's case, it was due to using the Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken technique a few days prior. King Kai instructs Goku to forget training for a while due to the disorder, tells him to spend time with <a href="/wiki/Pan" title="Pan">his granddaughter</a>. As Goku flies home, his <i>Ki</i> forces him to crash into and destroy his house, angering Chi-Chi. The next day, Goku, Chi-Chi and Goten are in Gohan's house as Piccolo is babysitting Pan. Piccolo then leaves as Goku and Chi-Chi gain the responsibility of babysitting Pan.

<p>At night, Goku and Piccolo are sitting with Pan on the roof. Goku tells Piccolo that his <i>Ki</i> is so out of shape that he would lose to Piccolo in a fight. Goku has fun with Pan and apologizes for his disorder, wanting to fly Pan around in the starry sky. The next morning, Pan disappears, and ends up in the hands of the Pilaf gang. Goku, along with the others start to look for her. Later that day, Gohan and Videl arrive back home, the others are exhausted, but Pan was sleeping soundly on the couch by the time they arrived. They deduce that overnight Pan must have crawled under the bed or in the closet. As Gohan tells Pan that Goku is not feeling well, Pan starts referring to Goku as "Gramps", and Goku starts to feel proud.

<p>Arriving in Universe 10, they meet Zamasu and Gowasu. Goku introduces himself to Zamasu and asks him for a fight but is stopped by Beerus, who tells Zamasu and Gowasu about Black. Goku asks to fight Zamasu again and Gowasu insists the fight happen. Goku goes Super Saiyan 2 and tries to punch Zamasu but he counters into what looks to be a finishing blow before Goku counters with a <i>ki</i> blast. He notices that the <i>ki</i> emanating from Zamasu is similar to that of Black. Goku overpowers Zamasu, defeating him in battle. He leaves with Beerus and Whis, hoping to fight Zamasu again some day.
</p><p>After a crash landing on Earth, the group have dinner and before leaving, Whis tells Future Trunks that Black and Zamasu have similar <i>ki</i> but differ in many ways. Later, Goku feels Vegeta and Future Trunks' <i>ki</i> while they are sparring. He teleports Bulma to their location where they watch as Vegeta harshly trains Trunks.
</p><p>In the manga, Black does not visit the past nor does he destroy the Time Machine. Instead, the group wait for it to be refuelled and pass the time by playing a racing video game. Additionally, Goku never visits Universe 10 and never meets Zamasu, who instead learns of him through watching <a href="/wiki/GodTube" title="GodTube">GodTube</a>.

<p>Goku and Vegeta engage Fused Zamasu in battle but are overwhelmed by his divine power. After Future Trunks and Vegeta are taken down, Goku uses his <a href="/wiki/God_Kamehameha" title="God Kamehameha">God Kamehameha</a> against Fused Zamasu's Holy Wrath, resulting in a huge explosion as the beam pierces Fused Zamasu's <i>ki</i> sphere, leaving the left side of his face and body disfigured. This leaves Goku strained to the point that he can no longer use his arms. Regardless, Goku attacks with a barrage of kicks and uses the power of <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Blue_Kaio-ken" title="Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken">Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken</a> to land a huge blow, destroying Fused Zamasu's divine halo. Goku falls to the ground exhausted as a furious Fused Zamasu powers up with <a href="/wiki/Light_of_Divine_Justice" title="Light of Divine Justice">Light of Divine Justice</a>.
</p><p>In the manga, Fused Zamasu hits Goku and Vegeta with fast strikes to the gut. They collapse to the ground, reverting to base from their Super Saiyan God forms. Goku goes Super Saiyan Blue and attacks Fused Zamasu, who deflects all of his strikes. Goku fires a God Kamehameha which pierces Fused Zamasu's chest, but he heals the wound due to his immortality. After continuing to overwhelm Goku and Vegeta, Shin gives Goku his Potara, suggesting they fuse into <a href="/wiki/Vegito" title="Vegito">Vegito</a>. Vegeta refuses and Goku heads back into the fight though continues to be overwhelmed. After hearing that the Potara fusion only lasts an hour, Vegeta asks for the earrings.
</p><p>In the anime, Goku suggests that he and Vegeta fuse and he reluctantly agrees. Gowasu explains that as Goku and Vegeta are not Supreme Kais, the Potara fusion will last one hour. The Saiyans use fuse into Vegito, who fights a climactic battle with Fused Zamasu in Super Saiyan Blue. Zamasu's body continues to mutate during the fight, becoming larger and more grotesque. Vegito begins to overwhelm Fused Zamasu but his fusion ends prematurely and the Saiyans are dropped to the ground with a tremendous punch.

Bergamo convinces Zeno to rescind the rule stating all losing universes are destroyed if he defeats Goku, to which Zeno agrees. The Grand Minister warns Goku that every universe will be immediately destroyed if he holds back. Bergamo allows Goku to hit him, which increases his size and strength. He goes Super Saiyan and continues to hit Bergamo and make him stronger.

The Grand Minister then decides to hold a Zeno Expo match featuring all of the Gods of Destruction. Goku watches as Beerus seems to effortlessly evade attacks for a moment, and Whis says his body is capable of doing it on its own. After the Grand Minister ends the match, Goku overhears Future Zeno talking about cancelling the tournament and insists he can put on a more exciting fight for them. The Grand Minister chooses Top as his opponent.
</p><p>He starts the fight off in Super Saiyan and is unable to land any attacks as Top tells him to take things seriously.

After Grand Minister announces the rules for the Tournament, he sends everyone back to their respective universe to build their teams.

<p>Goku fights Ribrianne, holding his own in his base form against her love-based arsenal of attacks. Their battle heats up, with Ribrianne transforming into Super Ribrianne. Goku easily overpowers her with Super Saiyan Blue and finally gets his wish as Jiren interrupts the fight and silently challenges him. Goku begins the fight in his base state and slowly powers up to test the Pride Trooper's abilities. Jiren is completely unfazed by Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 2, but exerts minor effort when confronted by Super Saiyan God. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue and the fight begins in earnest. The battle catches the attention of everyone in the Null Realm as Goku fights to his limit, utilizing X20 Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken and being held off with relative ease.

<p>Seeing no other choice, Goku drops back to his base form and gathers energy to create <a href="/wiki/Universe_7%27s_Spirit_Bomb" title="Universe 7&#39;s Spirit Bomb">Universe 7's Spirit Bomb</a>, all of Universe 7 contributing except for Vegeta, who declines out of pride (though he does protect Goku when Ribrianne tries to blindside him). Jiren takes the Spirit Bomb head on and pushes it back. The two struggle to control the massive concentration of <i>ki</i>, with Goku again utilizing X20 Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken. Ultimately, Goku's power gives out and he collapses, falling into his imploding Spirit Bomb. Initially believed to be dead, the remaining fighters prepare to collapse on Jiren. However, Goku emerges from the crater, having undergone a new transformation due to the power of the Spirit Bomb combining with his own innate energy to resist it. Unlocking his deepest potential, he has reached a state referred to by the gods as "<a href="/wiki/Ultra_Instinct_Sign" title="Ultra Instinct Sign">Ultra Instinct</a>".

Goku and Jiren resume their battle, the pair now appearing to be evenly matched. The battle rages until Goku burns through his new energy and drops back to his base form mid-attack. Jiren prepares to throw Goku from the ring before Hit intervenes, attacking Jiren. Goku retreats to rest, only to be accosted by Frieza who surprisingly heals him with a <i>ki</i> blast, admitting that he wants Goku to defeat Jiren for him. Goku is stunned when Jiren eliminates Hit from the tournament. Jiren tells Top and Dyspo to handle the rest of the tournament, as he has now eliminated all of the worthwhile warriors, giving Goku a pointed look which he takes with offence.

</p><p>In the manga, Goku's fight with Jiren resumes, taking to his Perfected Super Saiyan Blue form. Meanwhile, the rest of Team Universe 7 come under assault from a variety of fighters. As 17 takes care of Damom, Goku comments on how much of an asset he has been. Goku briefly joins Gohan and Roshi in a fight against three Pride Troopers, until Gohan points out that Frieza is in trouble against Super Saiyan Kale. Goku teleports to Frieza and powers up to Perfected Super Saiyan Blue. Despite Frieza's protests, he challenges Kale, gaining an early advantage but noting that Kale's power is increasing steadily. Frieza angrily kicks Goku out of the way, claiming that he can handle Kale himself. The two bicker until Kale powers up to a berserk state and goes on a rampage until she is fused with Caulifla to become Kefla. Gohan intercepts Kefla's attack on Goku and Jiren and says he'll deal with her while Goku resumes his battle against Jiren.

<p>In the anime, Jiren, Top, and Dyspo confront Team Universe 7. Goku and Jiren begin their second round of fighting and exchange their motivations. Vegeta interrupts the fight, intending to challenge Jiren himself. Goku and Vegeta take turns attacking Jiren, but neither can hold their own at first. Vegeta, however, soon finds a way to strike Jiren, and Goku is then left to watch Vegeta fight. He is amazed at Vegeta's strength when he prepares to use a <a href="/wiki/Final_Flash" title="Final Flash">Final Flash</a>, but is left shocked and worried when Jiren survives and severely wounds Vegeta. Goku jumps back into the fight afterwards. Despite various tactics and coming close to victory, Jiren recovers from Goku's onslaught and increases his battle power, which makes him strong enough that the shockwave of a single punch can knock Goku out of Super Saiyan Blue. However, Goku states that he cannot afford a loss. He activates Super Saiyan Blue in combination with the Kaio-ken, and watches as Vegeta powers up to <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God_SS_Evolved" title="Super Saiyan God SS Evolved">Super Saiyan God SS Evolved</a>.

<p>The two begin fighting Jiren and are able to put him on the defensive due to their pressure. Despite their effectiveness Jiren turns things around for himself and regains control. Soon afterwards Vegeta splits off to fight Top while Goku continues to take on Jiren. After Vegeta defeats Top, Goku is slapped aside by Jiren who commends Vegeta on his victory and powers up to full power. The trio of Goku, Vegeta and 17 are not able to make any progress but 17 sneaks up on Jiren and hurts him which allows Goku to see Jiren's weakness, which ironically is Goku's own flaw of dropping his guard.
</p><p>The trio try to recreate an opening for 17 to damage Jiren but to no avail and they are blasted and heavily injured before being rescued by Frieza though he is quickly taken down too. As 17 goes on to battle Jiren alone, Goku and Android 18 frantically tell 17 to run, with Goku believing 17 can actually win but 17 says he is giving up his wish and wraps both Goku and Vegeta in a barrier, telling them he hopes he bought them enough time as he blows himself up to stop Jiren's attack. Goku thanks 17 for his sacrifice before collapsing exhausted.

<p>In the manga, Goku goes for a combination attack on Jiren, which Jiren easily blocked and countered with a devastating gut punch, chastising the Saiyan for his repetitive offence. Knowing he still has a wall to overcome, Goku stresses his body to its limits, drawing from his reserves and uses the Kaio-ken. He lands some heavier blows on Jiren but the boost proves negligible as Jiren points out that Goku made the same mistake Kale did, trying to wield power gained by destroying the body. Seeing his old student on the ropes, Master Roshi tells Goku that he needs to conquer his own spirit rather than continuing to work on strength. 
</p><p>Goku thinks back to the words of all of his past masters, who taught him not to waste movement, to be tranquil and quick, to train his spirit, and to allow his body to act on its own. Roshi teaches Goku a final lesson on "how to move well" as he charges Jiren and manages to dodge a flurry of his strikes with graceful movements which Whis say resemble Ultra Instinct. Roshi is swiftly eliminated by Jiren and Goku praises his old master's teaching ability, declaring himself Son Goku of the <a href="/wiki/Turtle_School" title="Turtle School">Turtle School</a> as he enters the Ultra Instinct Sign state for the first time and dodges the incoming Jiren's attack. He prepares to fight Jiren in the new form, but snaps out of it before the fight begins and takes a heavy punch to the face.
</p><p>Vegeta, having reached the Super Saiyan God SS Evolved state battles against Jiren but he makes short work of him. After Goku teleports Vegeta to a safe hiding spot, Frieza and Android 17 buy time for Goku and Vegeta to recover, with 17 seemingly blowing himself up in a vain attempt to defeat Jiren. Jiren approaches the battered Saiyans and Goku taps into Ultra Instinct Sign once again. Jiren powers up, casting an aura for the first time in the tournament.

<p>In the anime, after Vegeta finally falls to Jiren, he gives all of his remaining energy to Goku with hope that he can win. Goku is able to hop up to his feet and goes Super Saiyan Blue as Jiren wonders why they trust Goku so much. Goku, annoyed and angry at Jiren for his view of the world says he wouldn't understand and attacks Jiren. Despite momentary success, Goku is beat back into base form where he tries again and to Jiren's astonishment is still able to keep up with him but Goku is beaten back to the edge of the ring.

<p>Goku struggles to stand as Vegeta screams out to him along with everyone else. Before Jiren's strike lands, Goku vanishes into thin air. A bewildered Jiren looks around and finds Goku having reawakened into Ultra Instinct. Jiren attacks as Goku casually dodges his blows and responds with a body strike that heavily injures Jiren. The bout continues until Jiren raises his energy to a level that blows Goku away. After Vegeta's words of encouragement, Goku stops Jiren's assault and closes his eyes, concentrating on focusing his heart and soul into the fight and suddenly begins to overwhelm Jiren. Jiren powers up more and blasts Goku to the boundary of being eliminated, unleashing thousands of punches with Goku only being able to block.

<p>Accepting defeat, Jiren asks Goku to finish it. However, before he can knock Jiren off, he is suddenly struck in the back by agonizing pain, causing him to collapse on the ground as dark bolts of <i>ki</i> engulf him while he screams in agony. Whis notes that the limit-breaking power of the gods has been too much for Goku's body to sustain. Jiren, emboldened by Belmod's words, blasts Goku out of the arena. However, before Goku is eliminated, a kiai hits his back, sending him onto a floating rock. Frieza stands there, revealing that he saved Goku while Android 17 also crawls out of a crack having survived.

<p>In the manga, Jiren pours on the offense against Goku, who is able to avoid substantial damage. The remarkably calm Goku tells Jiren that he's gotten rid of unnecessary emotions and that his heart is calm. Closing his eyes, he awakens the true state of Ultra Instinct, landing a powerful punch to Jiren's body. Goku gets the better of Jiren, dodging an enormous <i>ki</i> wave and connecting with a point-blank Kamehameha that pushes Jiren through the arena floor, with him just managing to pull himself up. Enraged, Jiren triggers his full power before attacking Goku, who is still able to control the fight. Jiren's increased power forces Goku to work harder, causing immense stamina drain. Ultimately, Jiren outlasts Goku's Ultra Instinct and Vegeta narrowly saves Goku from elimination.

<p>Goku teleports himself, Vegeta and Grand Supreme Kai to Moro's location on the verge of New Namek's atmosphere but is unable to continue the fight when Moro heads out further into space. After Merus assists Grand Supreme Kai and gives him the opportunity to grab hold of him, Moro is teleported back to New Namek where Goku and Vegeta await him. Moro informs the two of his third wish, to have all the prisoners from the Galactic Prison go free and they soon appear by his side having used a spaceship to get there. Moro shares his power with the prisoners, putting them into an empowered state before they gang up on Goku, Vegeta and Grand Supreme Kai but they get overpowered. However when Moro begins to absorb up their energy once again, the Saiyans and Kai begin to struggle. With the planet on the verge of destruction, Goku uses his Instant Transmission to teleport all of his allies but Vegeta, who chooses to go his separate way, back to Galactic Patrol Headquarters.

<p>After a few more days, Goku hears from Merus that Moro has grown even stronger and now stand virtually no chance of victory against him. Goku asks if this were to be true even if Merus were to be fighting seriously and he decides to give Merus a little test. He throws a punch at Merus which he effortlessly dodges even though Goku had meant for it to connect. Wanting to get a true feel for Merus' power the two move to a training room for a sparring session but even after progressing through Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan 3, Goku is still unable to land a hit on Merus. He asks Merus to train him believing that by doing so he could potentially master the Ultra Instinct that may be needed to defeat Moro. Merus agrees but suggests they can go elsewhere to train as the room can not withstand their power.

<p>A few days after Vegeta and Irico land on Yardrat, Goku travels with Merus on another planet to train. During their training session, Goku proceeds to punch and kick Merus but Merus effortlessly dodges Goku's punches and kicks, not taking any hits from him and counters his punches and kicks by hitting him with a staff to his back. Finding that Ultra Instinct will be one difficult technique to learn especially due to his emotions being all over the place when fighting, Goku tells Merus that in order to achieve Ultra Instinct he needs to empty his heart and mind. Merus then proceeds to charge toward Goku with his staff, and while Goku dodges Merus attacks with the staff, Merus reminds Goku that emotions can also translate into prodigious power such as Super Saiyan which is mainly triggered by rage though Merus points out that what he is after is the exact opposite.

<p>The training now in a halt, Merus reveals to Goku that he knew about Ultra Instinct all along and had a reason for keeping quiet about it much to Goku's surprise. Knowing that Merus is a good guy who has the same goal to defeating Moro, Goku doesn't mind Merus keeping his knowledge about Ultra Instinct quiet and proceeds to resume their training to learn this ability but Merus tells Goku to follow him inside a pyramid where he leads him to a room that resembles the Hyperbolic Time Chamber much to Goku's recognition. Merus tells Goku that 1 day that passes outside of the room is equivalent to 3 days inside of the room much to Goku's disappointment that they will only have 3 days to train but considers extra time better than no time. Merus reveals to Goku that the main reason why he brought him to the room is so that he can unleash his full power without anyone finding out about it.

<p>Merus goes into a fighting stance now serious and Goku assumes that Merus is not going to hold anything back against him to which Merus confirms this upon replying that he will impart all of his strength in their training and won't go easy on Goku. Merus asks Goku if he is prepared to continue their training and Goku with a smile on his face who goes into a fighting stance happily obliges to resume their training as he replies he was born ready. After continuing for a while, Goku begins to doubt that he even used Ultra Instinct after all. After Merus asks if it was first activated during an extreme crisis, he tells Goku the quickest way to achieve it again is to replicate those conditions and that Goku must be prepared to die during the process. During a break in the training to eat, Merus informs Goku of the news of Moro's men visiting Earth. Merus tells Goku that he has two months (six months in the room) before Moro himself heads to the planet and then continue their training.

<p>Two months later, with time almost up, Goku and Merus decide to have one last spar at full strength but they are interrupted by Whis who teleports them outside and reveals Merus as his younger brother and Angel. Before Whis takes Merus back to his realm, he tells Goku that he faith that he will defeat Moro. After they leave, Goku realises he has been left alone with just a Galactic Patrol ship that he would have to pilot himself and shouts for the Angels to come back. At some point, he gets lost on the way back to Earth and stops off of at a nearby planetoid to ask some locals for directions.

<p>As he gets closer to Earth, he begins to sense the battles taking place and his friends in trouble. He tries to use his Instant Transmission to teleport to them but is unable to get a hold of them until he senses Krillin's spiking chi. Arriving on Earth, just as the fusion of Miza, Kikaza and Iwaza are going in to finish off Krillin and Master Roshi, Goku knocks her out cold with a single attack before turning to Krillin and apologising for showing up late. When Krillin asks Goku if he thinks he can beat Moro, he says yes even though he could still be hiding some of his power. Goku teleports to Tien, Yamcha and Chiaotzu - who are losing their battle with Zauyogi - and proceeds to take down their foe in an instant. Yamcha informs Goku that Gohan and the others need him, and so Goku teleports away once more.

<p>As Saganbo continues to overwhelm Gohan and Piccolo in battle, Saganbo is suddenly attacked by Goku - moving too fast for anyone but Jaco and Moro to see. At Moro's request, Goku reveals himself and Moro notes that he has grown much stronger than he was before. Moro powers up Saganbo further and Goku engages him as a Super Saiyan Blue and proves to be the stronger. Believing the fight to be over, he prepares to battle Moro, only for Saganbo to stand up again, stronger still after receiving another power-up from Moro. Goku demands that Moro stop powering up Saganbo, who is clearly on his last legs, but Moro refuses, saying that he wants to see the ability Goku was using when he first arrived on the battlefield. As Goku attacks Moro to try and stop him, Saganbo suddenly collapses and dies.

<p>Angered by Saganbo's needless death, Goku vows that he will kill Moro for what he's done and unveils his new ability - Ultra Instinct Sign - which a shocked Moro recognizes as a technique of the gods. As the two get into battle positions, Goku throws a multitude of punches from a standstill position that act as air blasts which Moro has to block. Darting in close, Goku's heightened agility allows him to pressure Moro who in return attempts to immobilise him. Goku soon breaks free and charges forward, powering up a Kamehameha but turns away from Moro at the last second, realising that it is an illusion and fires the wave at the real Moro before continuing into an aerial battle. Goku begins to gain more of an edge until Moro uses his magic to draw him in close and the two land a hard simultaneous blow.

<p>Moro attempts to use his energy absorption technique on Goku but with a quick burst of speed he is able to dodge it and continues to hold an advantage over Moro while at close range. Moro stops fighting briefly to tell Goku that he is a fool for thinking that he is only capable of so much and powers up further still. In a near instant, Moro is able to grab Goku from behind and causes him to fall out of his Sign state. Moro points out that Goku was trying to rush the battle due to not having the stamina to keep the Sign level up for long and was why he didn't use it against Saganbo throughout their battle. Goku acknowledges his weakness but deduces that if Moro were stalling for time then it must mean he can not beat him at full power. Goku powers back up into Ultra Instinct Sign, apologising to Merus for not continuing his stamina balancing act any longer, deciding to fight at full strength.

<p>As both Goku and Moro begin to use their full strength, their auras begin to collide. Goku's wins out and he is able to push Moro back and the two fight an evenly matched battle until Goku knocks Moro down. After standing back up, Moro admits that he had been too cautious earlier and will not lose to Goku if that is the true extent of his power. As Goku begins to slow down after having reached his limit, Moro gains a clear edge in battle. Goku attempts one last desperate push to increase his power beyond his limits but Moro soundly begins to beat Goku down until he drops out of his Ultra Instinct Sign form.
</p><p>When he attempts to absorb Goku's energy, Android 17 and Android 18 intervene but fail to leave much of a mark on Moro. Vegeta finally returns to Earth using Instant Transmission with Goku surprised to see him pull the technique off then begins to watch as Vegeta is next to take Moro on.
</p><p>It soon becomes apparent that Moro is getting weaker as the battle progresses and Vegeta gains the upper hand. Goku realises what Vegeta has achieved and tells Gohan and Piccolo that Vegeta is using <a href="/wiki/Forced_Spirit_Fission" title="Forced Spirit Fission">Forced Spirit Fission</a>, something Goku was unable to learn previously. This allows Vegeta to liberate the stolen energy from Moro where he proceeds to release it to its point of origin. As Vegeta battles on, Piccolo notes his growth as a person which he believes is thanks to Goku. Goku is naturally oblivious to this, simply vowing to surpass him once again.

<p>Unfortunately, Moro's disadvantage is short lived. Absorbing Seven-Three, Moro achieves greater power and quickly takes Vegeta down. Goku gets to his feet and along with Gohan and Piccolo, despite being exhausted prepare to take him on. Though Vegeta returns almost immediately afterwards, Moro takes him down once again but not before stealing all of his abilities for himself. Gohan and Piccolo head in to engage Moro, with Gohan able to ensnare Moro using Gotenks' <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Donut" title="Galactic Donut">Galactic Donut</a> technique and Goku, back in his Super Saiyan Blue form, uses the <a href="/wiki/Instant_Kamehameha" title="Instant Kamehameha">Instant Kamehameha</a> to blast Moro at point blank range. This destroys Moro's arm but much to Goku's shock and horror, Moro quickly regenerates the arm and drives it straight through Goku's chest where he proceeds to collapse in a near death state.

<p>Thanks to the arrival of Whis and Merus on Earth, Goku and his fallen allies are transported outside of the barrier that Moro had erected. Due to being in the worst condition, Dende heals Goku first and then informs him that an Angel is currently in battle with Moro. Goku recalls being told of how Angels will disappear if they were to fight outside of training and concerned for Merus' well being he rushes back to the battlefield. Goku transforms into Ultra Instinct Sign once again and quickly takes over the battle but is unable to land a single blow before Moro sends him hurtling away. He tells Merus that despite all their training, he still hasn't gotten the hang of it. However, Merus tells him that his training did work and he is only a step away from achieving its true state. Merus re-enters the battle, using his true powers as an Angel to destroy the orbs on Moro's body to seal away his copy ability.
</p><p>As Merus begins to fade away, Goku looks on feeling distraught and helpless. Merus tells Goku that should he achieve Ultra Instinct again at his current level of strength, the form will be more stable and Moro, nor anyone else will be able to defeat him. He asks Goku to protect the galaxy that he has grown to love and disappears into the wind.

<p>Goku then begins to build up a new found level of strength but tries to calm himself down. Understanding that he isn't fighting alone and that Merus's sacrifice was for the universe as a whole, Goku accepts his position as a current member of the Galactic Patrol, acknowledging that it is now his job to protect the universe. Goku re-enters into the perfected Ultra Instinct state for the first time since the Tournament of Power and quickly establishes his superiority over Moro, blocking and dodging all of his attacks with ease before landing a mighty blow on Moro that shakes the entire planet.
</p><p>After Moro tries different yet futile strategies, Goku kicks him into a nearby rock, with the impact causing a large portion to fall onto Moro which traps him underneath. As Moro begs for his life, Goku confirms from Jaco that Moro had been sentenced to death leading him to remove his Gi with the Galactic Patrol insignia, stating that from now on he will fight Moro as an Earthling. Goku destroy the boulders pinning Moro then teleports over to the newly Krillin and takes the bag of Senzu from him.
</p><p>He offers to spare Moro's life if he promises to return to the Galactic Prison and stays there. Moro accepts and Goku tosses him a Senzu which he eats but unsurprisingly Moro breaks his promise and attacks Goku. However, Moro instead breaks his wrist on Goku's body. Goku calls him a coward that could never defeat him and reverts to his normal state asking Moro if he has ever trained before. When Moro says no, Goku calls it a pity as he could have grown stronger through training than he ever did by eating planets and would have loved the opportunity to fight with him again.

<p>Jaco urges Goku to finish off Moro and once more Goku asks if he will return to prison. Moro spots his previously severed arm behind Goku and vows to continue his ways causing Goku to tap back into Perfected Ultra Instinct to finish him. Moro summons his arm back towards him and attaches it, gaining Merus' power and ability and takes on a further evolved form. The two battle once more and fearful of the damage they could do to the Earth, Goku takes the skirmish into the sky with Moro amazed at what his body is now capable of. Racing across the planet, Moro kicks Goku into a mountain and as they continue, Moro's body begins to swell to several times its normal size with Whis explaining that his body is attempting to contain the Angel power coursing throughout him.
</p><p>As Goku gains the advantage he reminds Moro that he is now experiencing the same thing that Saganbo did before and urges Moro to give up the power before it destroys him. As Moro realises that he must attain a body strong enough to endure the power, Whis tells Goku that if he intends to kill Moro then he should do so now. Goku goes to finish the job only for Moro to merge himself with Earth. Whis tells everyone that Moro's fate is now tied to Earths and in addition, his body now risks detonating which will eradicate the galaxy along with it. 
</p><p>While Goku continues to try and fight off Moro, Beerus was about to join Goku in the fight, citing the situation calls for his interference. However before he can actually help Whis and Beerus are summoned by the Grand Minister to speak about Merus vanishing. Before taking off, Whis casually halt's Moro's attacks while telling Goku in order to save everything and fix his mistake he must destroy the crystal as Merus did. Goku questions if he can actually do that and Whis reminds him with Ultra Instinct he has godly power and is more then enough to do it.

<p>Before Goku get's a chance Moro sucks the crystal inside the Earth.

Before Goku can though he get's caught by Moro who drain's his energy. Piccolo along with Gohan and the rest of the team arrive and Piccolo believes Vegeta's Spirit Fission can work in reverse and wants Vegeta to take all of there Energy and give it to Goku. Their families along with Dende and Mr. Popo also contribute causing Goku to power back up to Super Saiyan Blue, but it still isn't enough to break free of Moro's grasp. Gohan asks how come Goku isn't using Ultra Instinct and Vegeta tells him he can't as he only got Godly Ki from Dende and it isn't enough to make him go Ultra Instinct again. Considering defeat Vegeta along with most of the Z-Fighter's give up seeing as Moro is literally moment's away from exploding, Gohan and Krillin opt to go directly to Goku to break him free in a attempt to save him.

<p>Suddenly Vegeta and Piccolo notice a gigantic ball of Godly Ki appearing above them. Dende realizes that it is coming from Uub, with assistance from the Grand Supreme Kai. Dende figures out that when Kid Buu was reincarnated as Uub, Uub received all of the Godly Ki he took from Grand Supreme Kai. Vegeta, not knowing where it is coming from thanks the individual and quickly uses his Spirit Fission and gives it to Goku. Fully restored Goku powers up to Ultra Instinct and grows in stature to overpower Moro. Once overpowering Moro, Goku flies out of his gigantic aura and smashes the crystal, killing Moro once and for all.

<p>Sometime later, Goku and Vegeta return to Beerus' Planet to continue their training. Goku catches the Oracle Fish for Whis so that he can inject him with some vitamins to help him sleep due to him currently having insomnia. Following this, Goku has a sparring session with Whis, transforming into Perfected Ultra Instinct at will. Despite the power up, he is still not able to land a blow on the Angel and is told that obtaining Ultra Instinct is merely the first step and now he must learn greater control over it. The thought of being able to grow stronger still excites Goku as he continues sparring.
</p><p>As he and Vegeta continue their separate training, Goku ponders which of them will be the strongest in the universe, even asking Whis if he knows of anyone stronger than them. When the Oracle Fish wakes up, she repeats her prophecy that soon the strongest warrior in the universe will rise up. Goku and Vegeta then pester the fish for answers as to who it is though she refuses to answer and Goku continues his training.
</p><p>Whis asks Goku what the fundamental difference is between himself and the Angels. After a quick demonstration where Goku finds himself whacked on the head by Whis' staff, Whis explains that they are always in the Ultra Instinct state whereas Goku transforms in order to access it, believing that he equates Ultra Instinct to his transformation. Goku then realises that he must learn to use Ultra Instinct in his normal form to which Whis tells him that doing so will free him of his stamina drain and that the transformation should be used as a last resort when he requires to surpass his limits.
</p><p>Over the next few weeks Goku makes significant progress with his training. When both he and Vegeta decide to head back to Earth to meet up with the Heeters members, Oil and Macki, who have requested their assistance in defeating a powerful villain, Whis marks his Gi once again with his signature. They board the Heeter's Spaceship and with 18 days until they reach their destination, Goku decides to take advantage of the ships chef and the gourmet cooking.
</p><p>They eventually arrive on Cereal with Goku alongside Vegeta flying to the villain unaware of them being tricked by the Heeters. While they are flying past a ruined city a bunch of random Ki blasts appear in front of them with the two barely able to dodge them. Goku using his refined Ultra Instinct is able to have an easier time dodging the blasts before landing on the ground before being surprised that the blasts didn't appear from there. Goku see's another barrage of blasts and proceeds to dodge them but is eventually caught by one with it striking one of his vital points. Goku recovers with a Senzu Bean and is called out by Vegeta for relying on his Ultra Instinct too much to which Goku agrees.

<p>Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan, spotting Granolah and firing a Energy Wave at him but the latter dodges and instantly teleports behind him, much to the former's surprise. The Cerealian unknowingly reveals he's the "villain" and knows the Saiyan race much to Goku's shock with Goku telling Vegeta if he knows of the Cerealians which Vegeta does not. Goku is then caught off guard when Granolah uses a similar technique to Hakai and asks Vegeta if he wants to work together which gets declined. Goku is told by Vegeta that he should go first as payback which Goku agrees and descends to the ground declaring he's the first to fight.

<p>Goku is asked by Granolah if he can turn into a Great Ape but Goku declines stating he can't pull off that transformation anymore. Goku transforms into Super Saiyan God then they engage in combat with Goku struggling to fight before using Ultra Instinct in conjunction with his form to dodge Granolah's attacks. Goku is eventually struck in one of his weak points and reverts back to base form. Goku is now aware of how Granolah is able to spot his weaknesses and listens as to why Granolah wants revenge on Frieza. With the knowledge of his intentions Goku questions the former if he's really an enemy. Goku sees Granolah powering up then says that he can not be called the strongest that easily and turns into Super Saiyan Blue, fighting equally with the latter.

<p>Goku battles against Granolah in and around a forested area, dodging blast and blow alike before Granolah swings around a tree by his scarf to deliver a flying kick on Goku. Goku recovers and stands his ground against the Cerealian's heavy blows, letting out a raging inferno of Ki that obliterates the surrounding area. Granolah notes with his evolved right eye that the flow of blood and movement of cells within Goku's body have altered; Goku has combined Ultra Instinct with the Perfected Super Saiyan Blue form. Goku begins to move around Granolah at incredible speed, evading his attacks before firing off a powerful Kamehameha at point-blank range. Granolah, however, is still able to land his <a href="/wiki/Pressure_Point_Attack" title="Pressure Point Attack">pressure point attack</a> at a vital point in Goku's neck as he is hit by the wave. 
</p><p>As the dust clears, Granolah is mildly damaged, but Goku is much worse for wear; having dropped down to his base form. Goku sticks to his belief that a true practitioner of Ultra Instinct should have no weak points, and that his training must be lacking. Granolah causes the ground beneath Goku's feet to swell and explode upwards with a fearsome energy that Goku struggles to counter. Goku desperately escapes with Instant Transmission and lands by Vegeta, noting that Granolah's technique is similar to Moro's. Vegeta informs Goku about his discoveries: the Cerealians were a race that were wiped out by the Saiyans under Frieza's command long ago. The Saiyan pair realize that Granolah is the last surviving Cerealian out for revenge, and that the Heeters lied to them about his villainy. Reasoning that nothing less than beating him will allow them to convince Granolah that the Saiyans are no longer his enemies, Goku claims to still have hope of victory and transforms once more into Perfected Ultra Instinct, as Granolah reels with shock; he cannot detect any pressure points.

<p>Goku attacks again, only this time, Granolah is unable to perceive his movements as the Saiyan launches a lightning-fast assault that tears off his sniping goggles and knocks him around the forest. Goku tries to reason with the vengeful warrior, but Granolah is unmoved and attacks Goku viciously. He is unable to penetrate the Saiyan's autonomous defence, and finds his blow halted by Goku's <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">telekinesis</a>, before being lifted into the air and punched by a series of <i>ki</i> blasts to the stomach. Vegeta believes the battle is won, but notices that Granolah's energy has not dropped as much as it should. He then detects Granolah's power coming from elsewhere.

<p>Granolah expresses surprise at the strength of the Saiyans. However, Granolah may have underestimated Goku, but he has not lost yet. He explains to a confused Goku that the Granolah he is facing is not his true self; he split his power apart at the start of the battle, taking some of the power of his true body and <a href="/wiki/Cloning" title="Cloning">creating an illusion clone</a> to fight. Vegeta finds the true Granolah, sitting in his spaceship, and alerts Goku as the clone vanishes into thin air. But as Vegeta turns back to the ship, the true Granolah teleports to Goku's location and strikes a pressure point directly over his heart that briefly stops it, causing him to drop out of Perfected Ultra Instinct. A final, devastating blow sends Goku crashing through the forest. 
</p><p>Granolah says that he wanted to save his true strength for Frieza, but having Goku fight a clone first worked to his advantage as the accuracy of his Perfected Ultra Instinct only drops over time. He then mocks Goku for falling for his trick and prepares to kill him with a <i>ki</i> blast, only to be interrupted by Vegeta. 
</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Goku wakes up and immediately suffers intense pain from the pressure point attack Granolah inflicted on him earlier, and begins to observe Vegeta's fight with Granolah. He begins to self heal his wounds so that he can get back into the action.

<p>Goku leaps back in to the fight in the nick of time to save Vegeta from a killing blow, however, Vegeta gets to his feet and unexpectedly roundhouse-kicks Goku into a nearby rock, angered at the thought of having the fight taken away from him. Vegeta then tells Goku that they had only ever fought together in the past when something needed protecting. Goku asks about his life which needs saving, though Vegeta scoffs at this and says he would rather die than team up with him. Unaware, Granolah charges in to strike a pressure point over Vegeta's heart, though Goku is able to save him in time by pushing him away using a Kiai.

<p>Granolah asks how he was able to react in time, with Goku saying that he now has a read on his vital targeting strategy and it will not work anymore. The two begin to battle with Granolah seemingly ending the fight fast with a pressure point attack to the back of Goku's neck. However, Goku attacks Granolah from behind, claiming that the same move will not work on him again. Granolah attempts another attack, but Goku is able to move his pressure points and counters with a punch. Goku says that he cannot dodge the attack completely, but is able to shift his pressure points enough to avoid fatal damage. Granolah praises his defensive ability, but claims that he will not surpass him as his attacking force is not up to par. Vegeta stirs and once more gets to his feet, watching as Goku is sent crashing to the ground and drops out of Perfect Super Saiyan Blue.

<p>When Monaito questioned Goku if there was any relation because of their resemblance, Goku was unsure because he was raised by Gohan on Earth. However, Vegeta soon reveals that Bardock was Goku's father, to the latter's shock. Goku soon remarks he wish he knew more about his father while Vegeta comments that the kindness really is genetic in Goku's family. Shortly afterwards, <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">Gas</a> emerges, having now become the strongest in the universe thanks to <a href="/wiki/Elec" title="Elec">Elec</a>'s summoning the dragon and making the wish.

As Monaito heals Goku of his wounds, the recovering Saiyan asks Vegeta to go get the Senzu Bean that was stored away in his armour and tells him to eat it. Goku attempts to buy him some time and heads back into battle as Super Saiyan Blue but finds himself far outmatched.
</p><p>Granolah soon returns to take over the battle in Goku's stead who then watches events unfold with Vegeta. Granolah appears to defeat Gas using his superior skill set however when Elec shows up and removes Gas's necklace, his instincts are unleashed, giving him access to far greater power than before though he is initially in a wild and frenzied state. During his rampage, he quickly takes down Granolah before savagely kicking Vegeta and taking him down. Goku rushes in with a punch and though it is blocked, Gas is reminded of his battle with Bardock long ago and backs off. Gas soon snaps out of his madness as his body undergoes a new form.

<p>After Gas breaks Granolah's arms and Elec fatally shoots him in the back, Vegeta gives his remaining ki to Goku. Goku takes a deep breath then goes Perfected Super Saiyan Blue. Gas attacks Goku with a multitude of special weapon-based energy techniques, followed by using Telekinesis to throw buildings at the Saiyan before striking him with a moving train. Goku flips up on to the top of the train and Gas joins him. Asking Goku to show his true strength, he notices that he does not seem to have the same fierce resolve that his father once had and questions if he really is his son. Goku is sent into the lake below and begins to suffocate underwater, however not satisfied by such a simple death, he returns Goku's counter attack right back at him. As Goku wonders how he is going to be able to defeat his opponent, Gas spots Monaito using his Healing powers to partially restore Granolah. Gas makes a bee-line for Monaito but before he is able to reach him, Goku grabs a hold of him and uses Instant Transmission to teleport them off of Cereal. 
</p><p>After crash landing on another planet and greeting Jaco, Goku confidently states that Gas has an inferior version of teleportation than his own and baits Gas to teleport into embarrassing positions. Next, Goku and Gas are teleported into the Galactic Prison where Gas is mocked by villains from the past.
</p><p>On a volcanic planet, Goku appears nearby Whis and the Oracle Fish, followed shortly by a confused Gas. Goku reveals his ploy: he leaves using Instant Transmission back to the Galactic Patrol ship he just left. From there, he quickly chains together a sequence of Instant Transmissions before finally landing back on Cereal. Gas realizes that Goku has stranded him and is too far away to directly return to Cereal with Instant Transmission. Unable to follow Goku back along their route, Gas furiously asks Whis for the direction to Cereal, which he provides. Gas takes off into space at incredible speed.

<p>Goku regroups with the others, having bought them some time. Oatmeel is also present, having activated a mobile android mode to help out. In a hovercar on the way to Monaito's house, Goku is contacted by Whis who warns Goku that Gas is approaching and will return in 20 minutes. At the house, Monaito tells Goku that he has something to show him; Bardock's Scouter. Oatmeel begins to play the Scouter's stored audio, and Monaito recognizes Bardock's voice, warning him to escape with Granolah from the battle with Gas 40 years ago. He tells them to "Stay alive", awakening a deep, repressed memory within Goku of Bardock and Gine telling him the same thing as they sent him away from Planet Vegeta before its destruction.

<p>Now able to compete with Hearts on equal grounds but is pushed back as Hearts comments that Goku's desire to fight can only be satisfied by him, which Goku rebuffs. The two acknowledge that neither is still using their full power. When the fight commences again, Goku turns the tides on him and overwhelms Hearts with a Kamehameha. However Hearts gets back on his feet and taunts Goku before using his Gravity powers on him. When Hearts uses his Gravity Fist technique, Goku is shown to be at a disadvantage as Hearts begins to power up even further. Hearts draws his energy cubes towards him and charges at Goku hard enough to send him to the ground and out of his Super Saiyan Blue form.

<p>After Kamioren undergoes a transformation after merging with the power of the Universe Seed, Goku intervenes and stops one of Kamioren's punches aimed for Vegeta but is far overpowered and caught in his grip. After struggling to break free, he enters into his Ultra Instinct Sign state once more and instinctively dodges Kamioren's punches and energy blasts. Kamioren fires a <a href="/wiki/Mouth_Energy_Wave" title="Mouth Energy Wave">Mouth Energy Wave</a> at Goku which he stops in it's tracks and sends back at his enemy. As he brings his opponent down to his knees, Kamioren fires another energy wave but this time around is able to catch him.

He takes down the entire Dragon Team with a single blow each but Goku manages to regroup himself and fights on, but unable to transform due to being exhausted of energy from recently using Ultra Instinct, he is at a disadvantage and Zamasu soon twists his arm around his back. He is saved by the appearance of Jiren and soon after Hit. The three attempt to take on Zamasu but are pushed back by a pulse from the newly completed Universe Seed.

Hearts takes Goku down with a single blow along with the others but as they get to their feet, Goku is the first to attack, transforming into a Super Saiyan Blue. However, his momentum is halted as Hearts tells him that he can see his movements and his heart before sending him flying backwards. After suffering through another onslaught, Goku suggests to Vegeta that they should fuse, not knowing when his Ultra Instinct may be available to him again. While his friends buy him time, Goku and Vegeta complete the process to fuse into <a href="/wiki/Gogeta" title="Gogeta">Gogeta</a>.
</p><p>Gogeta eventually defeats Hearts and returns peace to the Earth. Jiren asks why they didn't fuse together during the Tournament of Power. Before Gogeta can respond, he defuses back into Goku and Vegeta individually. Vegeta finishes the explanation that it's because he never wants to fuse with Goku. Goku laughs off the comment, saying that next time he will deal with the enemy all by himself.

<p>Shortly after arriving, Fu appears, followed by Towa who teleports everyone away, leaving only Vegeta, Goku and Fu left at the Time Rift. When Vegeta attempts to take on Fu, he is overtaken when Fu uses Cumbers <a href="/wiki/Evil_Aura" title="Evil Aura">energy</a>, that he has obtained for his own use, to turn Vegeta <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God_Super_Saiyan_(Berserk)" title="Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Berserk)">Berserk</a>. Goku transforms into Super Saiyan Blue and tries to aid Vegeta but he too is taken over. The two enraged Saiyans flail wildly at Fu who easily fends them off before purifying them of their Evil Aura. With time running short and the Universe Tree close to destroying their universe, Goku removes a Potara from his pocket that he retrieved from Salsa and tosses it to Vegeta where they fuse once more into Vegito.

When Vegeta appears, Goku fuses him with again to become Gogeta and fights along Xeno Gogeta but the two are quickly overpowered and defuse. Fu then throws the Vegeta's into a dark vortex to prevent further fusion, but the Goku's receive some unexpected backup in the form of Chronoa. Chronoa heals the pairs injuries and asks that the two power up to their limit. She then performs a technique that allows the two Saiyans to merge their Ki together. They attack with a combined Kamehameha, which breaks through all of Fu's barriers, forcing him to block it himself. Despite Fu stating the attack was dangerous, Xeno Goku notes that, even with this immense power, he and his alternate self are still unable to beat the Dark King.

<p>Ten years after the defeat of the evil, pure <a href="/wiki/Kid_Buu" title="Kid Buu">Majin Buu</a>, Goku kept training despite the fact that Earth was at peace. He is training with his youngest son, Goten. When the tournament comes around, Goku forces Goten to cancel his date to enter and Goten shows disdain toward Goku's ruling. During the 28th World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku battles Majin Buu's reincarnation, <a href="/wiki/Uub" title="Uub">Uub</a>, who was born after King Yemma heard his request made ten years ago. However, Uub was experiencing an extreme bout of stage fright, so Goku was forced to make several insults towards his family and obscene gestures to try and get him angry enough to fight and overcome his fear.

<p>After a short, yet intense battle, Goku apologizes and explains to Uub that his insults were simply meant to coax him into using his true power. Goku then takes Uub to train him to one day help in being the protector of the planet, although he later tells Uub that after the training, he desires to fight him again not only to discover the strongest out of the two, but the strongest in the entire universe. Then they fly off in the distance (in <i>Kanzenban</i>, Goku gives Uub, his Nimbus Cloud).

Soon after Uub leaves the lookout and Goku finds out what is going on, an accidental wish by Emperor Pilaf transforms Goku back into a child. This wish was made on the <a href="/wiki/Black_Star_Dragon_Ball" title="Black Star Dragon Ball">Black Star Dragon Balls</a>. As a result, Goku must travel the galaxy and return them to Earth to prevent the planet from exploding from the negative energy created by the wish.

<p>After leaving Earth in <a href="/wiki/Grand_Tour_Spaceship" title="Grand Tour Spaceship">the spaceship</a> designed by Bulma, a piece of the ship falls off and Goku, <a href="/wiki/Trunks" title="Trunks">Trunks</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pan" title="Pan">Pan</a> are forced to crash land on the planet <a href="/wiki/Imecka" title="Imecka">Imecka</a> to get the parts needed to repair the ship. Groups of merchants swarm Goku and the others and they have to go to the gold star hotel to hide from the swarms of sellers. They then realize they are being charged every second for everything in the hotel including the lights. They escape without paying and stumble upon the house of an old couple and their children. They talk about <a href="/wiki/Don_Kee" title="Don Kee">Don Kee</a>, the ruler of the planet, and how he mistreats his people. Just then, <a href="/wiki/Imeckian_Army" title="Imeckian Army">Don Kee's men</a> come and repossess the old couple's house saying they were behind on payment. Goku suggests that they go and fight Don Kee, but the couple says that is impossible because of his grand army. On their way back to the ship Trunks drops the Dragon Radar and it is swallowed by a small robot named T-2006, nicknamed <a href="/wiki/Giru" title="Giru">Giru</a>, who says that he can not give the radar back to them because it is already integrated into his system.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Goku notices the ship being dragged away by Don Kee's men. He tries to use Instant Transmission to teleport them to the ship, but after two failed attempts, he realizes that he can not use it with his small body. They are forced to travel to Don Kee's palace on foot to recover their ship. Pan decides that they will use a stealth operation to recover the ship and would only result to fighting as a last resort. After briefly sneaking around, a large rock falls on Trunks' head and Giru starts making noises that alarm the guards. The guards open fire on Goku and the others and Pan says that they must fight now, so Goku agrees. Pan jumps in the carrying car while Goku moves the ship onto the car and Pan drives the ship out of the palace with Goku and Trunks. While escaping, Don Kee's henchmen <a href="/wiki/Gale" title="Gale">Gale</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sheela" title="Sheela">Sheela</a> fire a <a href="/wiki/Combined_Energy_Wave" title="Combined Energy Wave">combined Energy Wave</a> at Goku, but Goku deflects it back with ease towards <a href="/wiki/Ledgic" title="Ledgic">Ledgic</a>, Don Kee's right-hand man who recognizes them as Saiyans. Goku and the others escape, but Trunks says they have to go back into town for more parts due to Pan's "reckless driving".

<p>Once they reach the town, everyone hides and Trunks finds the three of them on Imecka's most wanted list. While running from Don Kee's soldiers, they fall into the house of a nice old couple who offer them food after realizing Goku and company mean no harm. They say that Don Kee made it a law that no one is allowed to own a ship so that no one would escape the planet including the old couple. Pan gets fed up and convinces Goku and Trunks to go face Don Kee head on. They turn themselves into the police and get brought to the palace. Once there, Goku, Trunks, and Pan incapacitate Gale, Sheela, and all of Don Kee's guards. Then Goku blasts his way into Don Kee's throne-room. Don Kee sicks Ledgic on the fighters after capturing Pan in an energy chamber. Ledgic says that he will fight Goku, but for his own satisfaction. After a short fight, Goku defeats Ledgic as a Super Saiyan and they take down Don Kee and make him give everyone free rent and give them back their ships free of charge. Plus Don Kee gives them the parts they need for free and they leave Imecka. They then land on an unnamed planet where everything is larger than life. Goku finds the Four Star Ball in the tooth of a giant and they go to the next planet.

<p>On planet <a href="/wiki/Gelbo" title="Gelbo">Gelbo</a>, they find the Six-Star Dragon Ball in the hair of the princess of the village, <a href="/wiki/Leena" title="Leena">Leena</a>. Trunks asks for the ball, but her fiancé <a href="/wiki/Doma" title="Doma">Doma</a> said that they were in a large problem already. The amphibian creature <a href="/wiki/Zoonama" title="Zoonama">Zoonama</a> was threatening the village with his power to create earthquakes and volcano eruptions by shaking his whiskers if they did not give him a wife. Goku decides that he would help them out in exchange for the Dragon Ball and they agree. Pan comes up with the idea to disguise Goku as Leena, but it does not work out, so Trunks poses as Leena instead. Zoonama comes and starts getting impatient waiting for Leena and threatens to shake his whiskers. Then Trunks arrives dressed as Leena and Zoonama takes him to his layer. Trunks gets Zoonama tipsy and Goku arrives with Pan and Doma. Doma slices off Zoonama's left whisker with a huge pair of scissors and as he cuts off the left one, Zoonama awakens in a drunken rage. He begins to wiggle his whiskers and an earthquake begins to come, but stops soon after while Zoonama continues to wiggle his whisker. Pan realizes that he can not cause earthquakes, he can only predict them. But now he is so tipsy that he did not realize that the quake was over. Suddenly a really big earthquake erupts and Goku and the others leave the cavern with Zoonama. Goku then stops the huge volcano with a Kamehameha, saving the city and winning the Dragon Ball. Just as they are leaving the planet, <a href="/wiki/Bon_Para" title="Bon Para">Bon Para</a>, one of the mysterious <a href="/wiki/Para_Brothers" title="Para Brothers">Para Brothers</a>, arrives and takes the ball from Pan's hands using his <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">telekinesis</a>. In shock, the three Z Fighters just watch as he leaves.

<p>Goku, Trunks, and Pan arrive on Earth to return the Black Star Dragon Balls, but soon discover that Baby has infected the population with mind-controlling eggs and chosen Vegeta as his new host. After a short fight with Baby, Goku discovers that he can not sustain Super Saiyan 3 while still being a child. After being pummeled by Baby Vegeta, Goku is weak and defenseless. During this fight, however, Goku learns of Baby's one weakness; he is sensitive to taunts, and easily angered. Meanwhile, Baby uses the <a href="/wiki/Revenge_Death_Ball" title="Revenge Death Ball">Revenge Death Ball</a> to finish off Goku, but Kibito Kai arrives just as the bomb strikes to save Goku and bring him to the Sacred World of the Kais.

<p>There, Old Kai hatches a plan to "solve Goku's energy problem" by re-growing Goku's tail. Progress is slow at first, but Goku has an idea about how to accelerate the process. After a very painful procedure where the tail is pulled out by a pair of pliers, Goku returns to the Tuffle planet (where most of Earth's residents had migrated to) to confront Baby. During the long and hard battle with Baby Vegeta, Goku is able to sustain his Super Saiyan 3 form, but is still unable to win. As he lies on the ground, defenseless, he gazes at Earth and realizes he has failed it. But instead of dying, looking at the Earth causes Goku to transform into the form of a <a href="/wiki/Golden_Great_Ape" title="Golden Great Ape">Golden Great Ape</a>. With Pan's help, Goku regains control of himself and become a <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_4" title="Super Saiyan 4">Super Saiyan 4</a>.

<p>Baby Vegeta is no match against a Super Saiyan 4. In desperation, Bulma (who's under Baby's control) uses a Blutz Wave Generator that causes Baby Vegeta to transform into a Golden Great Ape. Although Goku outclasses Baby in terms of speed, he is slowly worn down by Baby's power. Just as Old Kai loses all hope of Goku succeeding, Kibito Kai removes Gohan, Goten, and Trunks from Baby's control using the Sacred Water from Kami's Lookout. After realizing that they cannot help by fighting the ape, they channel some of their energy to Goku. Goku eventually succeeds in defeating Baby Vegeta and leaves him defenseless. In desperation, Baby leaves Vegeta's body and tries to escape from Planet Tuffle, but Goku uses his Kamehameha attack to destroy Baby and blast his remains into the sun.

Goku leaves for Hell, where he meets Dr. Myuu and Dr. Gero, who leave, making Goku very frustrated with no way out, until two of his most fierce enemies of the past drop by, Cell and Frieza. Goku manages to deal with both of them in his normal state. Realizing Goku's power, Cell forces out his tail and absorbs Goku. This only lasts for about ten seconds, since Goku finds his way out of Cell's body.

<p>Proving to be more than a match for the Super Saiyan 4 Goku, Goku is severely beaten by the most powerful of all the Shadow Dragons, losing his Super Saiyan 4 transformation and falling unconscious. Goku's friends provide him with their own power, which makes Goku transform to <a href="/wiki/Super_Full_Power_Saiyan_4" title="Super Full Power Saiyan 4">Super Full Power Saiyan 4</a> and finally become superior to Syn. Unfortunately, the Evil Dragon absorbs the other Dragon Balls into himself, becoming Omega Shenron. Even as a Ultra-full-power Saiyan 4, Goku can't defeat the powered-up dragon. He even combines 2 of his strongest attacks in the form of <a href="/wiki/Dragon_Hammer" title="Dragon Hammer">Dragon Hammer</a> but Omega still survives this. After Vegeta (now a Super Saiyan 4) joins the fight, they still can't beat him so Vegeta suggests that they fuse to which Goku agrees, even mentioning that this will be "special". Due to fusing Super Saiyan 4 <a href="/wiki/Gogeta" title="Gogeta">Gogeta</a> is born. However, the fused warrior does not finish off the evil Shadow Dragon before the fusion wears off due to wasting too much time. Later Goku's power runs out and he reverts to his base child form. After being presumably killed by Omega's <a href="/wiki/Negative_Karma_Ball" title="Negative Karma Ball">Negative Karma Ball</a>, Goku asks the people of the planet Earth to send him their energy. The collected energy is not enough to defeat Omega Shenron, so Goku asks King Kai to help him by gathering energy from all over the universe, creating the <a href="/wiki/Super_Ultra_Spirit_Bomb" title="Super Ultra Spirit Bomb">Super Ultra Spirit Bomb</a>. The Spirit Bomb is successful in destroying Omega Shenron.

<p>The people of Earth witness this and finally realize Goku is a hero. Afterward, the real Shenron appears once again, saying that no more wishes will be granted for a long time. After convincing Shenron to grant one last wish and asking that all the people who were killed by Super 17 and the Shadow Dragons be revived, Goku decides to accompany the dragon. Before leaving, Goku tells Vegeta that the lives of everyone are now in his hands, passing the role of protector of the Earth and anyone in need of help, to Vegeta. Goku also visits Krillin, who has recently been revived by the last wish, and the two of them have one last fight before Goku flies off with Shenron. He then visits Hell to apologize to Piccolo for "putting him through nothing but trouble", vowing to remember him for as long as lives. With all loose ends tied up, Goku disappears along with Shenron.

<p>A century later, as an aged Pan watches the World Martial Arts Tournament, she catches a glimpse of a familiar face in the stands: her grandfather, Goku (now grown up once again, and without his tail). When she tries to follow him, however, he disappears. Goku leaves since the earth is at peace but the narrator says he will always return when the earth is in danger. Goku is then seen flying into the air, grabbing onto his Power Pole, calling for the Flying Nimbus and finally flies off into the distance while yelling, "Til we meet again, guys!"

<p>As they completed their training earlier, Master Roshi takes his students Goku and Krillin to a Martial Arts Tournament held by the <a href="/wiki/Mifan" title="Mifan">Mifan</a> Emperor Chiaotzu. In a bar the night before, the gang helps Bora and Upa against the <a href="/wiki/Mifan_Army" title="Mifan Army">Mifan Army</a> and Goku has a brief fight against Major Metallitron. The next day, Goku witnesses Yamcha's defeat at the hands of Bora and Bora's death at the hands of General Tao. Furious, Goku enters the ring and fights against Tao, but is defeated and blasted by a Dodon Ray from Mifan to the top of Korin Tower where he meets Korin. Korin gives Goku some advice, saying that the reason he lost against Tao was due to being angry during the fight and wasn't seeing things clearly which causes Goku to see the error of his ways. At the bottom of the tower, Goku meets Arale and the Gatchans. They take on General Tao and manage to defeat him by kicking missiles back at him. Goku returns to Mifan and rescues Upa from Major Metallitron by flying straight through his midsection. After the defeat of Minister Shen, the gang uses the Dragon Balls to resurrect Upa's father back to life.

<p>Goku and Piccolo team up to battle Super Garlic Jr and after removing their weighted clothing, they are able to stop him. Thinking Garlic defeated, they start to fight with each other due to Piccolo wanting to settle the score. In the middle of their duel, Garlic Jr. comes back and opens a portal to the Dead Zone, trying to suck everybody in. Gohan gets angry at seeing Goku in danger, and, unconsciously releasing his power, he pushes Garlic Jr. into the Dead Zone, sealing him inside. Surprised to see Gohan's power and then later that he didn't even realise that he had done so, Gohan decides not to tell Chi-Chi about what happened.

<p>Though most of the Z Fighters are defeated, Goku is able to best all of them using the Kaio-ken technique. Turles is far stronger, but Goku gives a fair fight using the Kaio-ken. However, after Turles eats the fruit from the Tree of Might, Goku starts to lose his ground. Goku attempts a Spirit Bomb while the Z Fighters divert Turles' attention but it is too weak due to the tree having absorbed up too much of the planets energy. Goku tries once again this time taking the energy from the Tree of Might itself and Goku is finally able to destroy both Turles and the Tree of Might. Afterwards he goes on a camping trip with his friends.

Gohan takes him to hide in a cave, and goes to get Senzu Beans to help him recover, while Cooler's troops try to find them. On his way back, he is attacked by Cooler's henchmen, but Piccolo stalls them long enough to let Gohan get a bean to Goku. Salza ultimately caught up with Gohan and destroyed the bean container, which caused Goku to express disbelief before passing out in despair, although he managed to get another bean (due to Yajirobe supplying Gohan with a free bean earlier) from Gohan.

After getting there, they discover that Cooler was saved by the <a href="/wiki/Big_Gete_Star" title="Big Gete Star">Big Gete Star</a> from his destruction, and is now back as a machine, leading an army of robots that have enslaved the Namekians.

<p>Even after turning into a Super Saiyan, Goku fails to gain the upper hand due to Cooler's <a href="/wiki/Rebirth" title="Rebirth">Rebirth</a> ability. When Goku is caught up in a choke hold, he is saved by Vegeta who also turns into a Super Saiyan. Eventually the two are able to combine their powers and are able to stop Meta-Cooler. Unfortunately for the two, thousands of copies of Cooler appear, who proceed to knock down and capture the two <a href="/wiki/Saiyan" title="Saiyan">Saiyans</a>. They awaken to find themselves tangled up, in front of the <a href="/wiki/Meta-Cooler_Core" title="Meta-Cooler Core">Meta-Cooler Core</a>. Cooler tries to steal the Saiyan's energy to give more power to the Big Gete Star, but Goku and Vegeta are able to overload it by sending all of their energy at once. They thus destroy the Big Gete Star and the robot army, and Goku and Vegeta manage to <a href="/wiki/Ki_Burst_Sphere" title="Ki Burst Sphere">blast</a> the last remains of Cooler.

<p>Goku is in a suit in order to help Chi-Chi with getting Gohan in a school, repeatedly being told what to say to the interviewers so they can leave a good impression. During the interview, he is contacted by King Kai who warns him about the appearance of the <a href="/wiki/Legendary_Super_Saiyan" title="Legendary Super Saiyan">Legendary Super Saiyan</a> and the damage he has already dealt to the South Galaxy. Apologizing to Chi-Chi for having to leave, Goku teleports to King Kai's Planet. There, after being fed a ten course meal, he is told about that this new Saiyan is even stronger than Goku and he becomes excited by it.

Broly breaks free of his father's control and attacks Goku and the Z Fighters, who are no match for him. Goku is the last one still standing and all the beaten fighters give their energy to Goku, including Vegeta after some convincing. Goku then uses all the power that the Z-Fighters gave him to power one punch, defeating Broly. Goku escapes with his friends using Instant Transmission, just before the asteroid destroys the planet. Upon returning home, he tells Chi-Chi that his favorite hobbies are reading and sports, the same phrase that Chi-Chi wanted Goku to say at the school interview. Chi-Chi then faints out of exasperation.

He had been freed from his imprisonment when Cell made King Kai's planet explode, thanks to Goku. The Z Fighters are unable to defeat Bojack and <a href="/wiki/Galaxy_Soldiers" title="Galaxy Soldiers">his band</a>, and when Bojack starts to bear-hug Gohan to death, Goku teleports to Earth using Instant Transmission (something somehow against the rules of the dead), which allows him to appear briefly and punch Bojack away. Goku also tells Gohan to protect the Earth and unleash all the anger and power he had in him. Goku then vanishes back to the Other World. Not sure if he really saw his father, Gohan is nevertheless encouraged enough to release his power and defeat Bojack.

<p>Goku is fighting with Pikkon in the Other World tournament ring when <a href="/wiki/Janemba" title="Janemba">Janemba</a> appeared and the barriers between dimensions were disrupted. Because Other World was no longer isolated from the physical plane, those who had died were able to walk amongst the living. Goku used Instant Transmission to go to King Yemma's check-in station with Pikkon and saw the first form of Janemba sitting on the station's roof. Eager to engage Janemba in battle, Goku gleefully left Pikkon behind to free Yemma (much to Pikkon's dismay). Goku was soon forced to use his Super Saiyan 3 form to combat Janemba's unique arsenal of techniques.

<p>At Super Saiyan 3, Goku made quick work of Janemba, only to be outclassed when Janemba transformed into a smaller, fiercer <a href="/wiki/Demon" title="Demon">demon</a>. Vegeta soon arrived on the scene (no longer being confined to Hell due to the disruption in the dimensional barriers) and was persuaded by Goku to attempt the Fusion Dance. Their first attempt failed and produced a fat Veku. Due to sheer luck, they were able to survive against Janemba until the fusion expired. After regrouping, Goku and Vegeta were able to fuse properly while Pikkon distracted Janemba. Gogeta appeared as a Super Saiyan and destroyed Janemba with ease. Later, Goku and Vegeta are seen standing at the Blood Pond where Vegeta vanishes and goes back to Hell. Goku hopes that they can see each other again, but like in the series, Vegeta only tells him "we're never fusing again."

<p>When Goku, Gohan and Goten try to attack him, it is ineffective because Hirudegarn is too fast. Later, Gotenks is formed and he gets Hirudegarn down, but it only made him transform and Hirudegarn knocks Gotenks out. When there was almost no hope left, Goku transformed into Super Saiyan 3 and started to fight Hirudegarn. When Trunks wanted to help Goku, he said that he wanted to handle Hirudegarn alone. Goku notices Hirudegarn's weakness, that it's intense emotions drain it's energy, leaving it open to attack. He taunts Hirudegarn which causes it to become angered, dodging one last punch, Goku strikes with his <a href="/wiki/Dragon_Fist" title="Dragon Fist">Dragon Fist</a> that defeats the monster for good. Goku then joins the others as they bid farewell to Tapion.

Beerus wonders how Goku was able to defeat Frieza as he is but realizes he could upon becoming a Super Saiyan. Beerus and Whis prepare to head to Earth to ask the other Saiyans, who can also transform into a Super Saiyan.

Goku asks Beerus if he wants Goku to power back down to Super Saiyan 2, and the unimpressed Beerus says to stay as he is and just attack him. Goku does so, and despite Goku's efforts (including punching straight through King Kai's planet) Beerus easily defeats him with a chop to the neck.

<p>Before Beerus can destroy the Earth after winning a rock-paper-scissors match with Oolong, he is interrupted by Goku's arrival. Goku asks Beerus if he can spare some time so Goku can use the Dragon Balls to ask Shenron about the Super Saiyan God. Shenron, flustered at Beerus' presence, explains the origin of the Super Saiyan God and how to create one. Goku begins to absorb the energies of Gohan, Goten, Trunks and Vegeta, and while he has powered up greatly, Beerus explains to him that he still has not become a Super Saiyan God despite absorbing everyone's energy. Whis reminds them of what Shenron said: they need 5 Saiyans to instill their energy into another, so the group realize they are short one Saiyan. Videl, revealing to the group that she is pregnant with Gohan's <a href="/wiki/Pan" title="Pan">child</a>, partakes in the ritual, and Goku successfully becomes a <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God" title="Super Saiyan God">Super Saiyan God</a>.

<p>Goku then engages in a fierce battle with Beerus, which takes place at several different parts of the world due to their immense speed and power. The two fight an equal battle until Goku and Beerus both point out that they're holding back. Beerus begins to take the fight more seriously as Goku then loses his Super Saiyan God form. However, despite of this, he continues to fight an equal battle with Beerus, who explained to Goku that he absorbed the power of Super Saiyan God and in turn caused his body to grow stronger. While blocking Beerus' <a href="/wiki/Sphere_of_Destruction" class="mw-redirect" title="Sphere of Destruction">Sphere of Destruction</a>, Goku briefly becomes a Super Saiyan God again and absorbs the blast, but this causes Goku to become extremely exhausted and power down. Beerus says he had fun with his match with Goku and calls him his second strongest opponent. As Goku falls to the ground, Beerus prepares to blow up the Earth but due to using most of his energy, only destroys a small rock formation. Beerus and Whis befriend the Z-Fighters, promising to come back for more delicious food, and they leave. Afterwards, Bulma's birthday party is continued, and Goku tells Vegeta he saw Vegeta's <a href="/wiki/Quake_of_Fury" class="mw-redirect" title="Quake of Fury">power-up</a> upon Beerus hitting Bulma and begins to make fun of him for it.

<p>Four months after Frieza's revival, Goku and <a href="/wiki/Vegeta" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a> face off against <a href="/wiki/Whis" title="Whis">Whis</a> on <a href="/wiki/Beerus%27_Planet" title="Beerus&#39; Planet">Beerus' Planet</a> as part of their training to gain control over their godly energy and more power. The two are unable to land a single blow on Whis and are soon taught their flaws by the godly attendant. Beerus wakes up and asks what they are doing on his planet, realizing Whis is training them with Earth's food as an incentive. Goku says he has no interest in taking over Beerus' job as God of Destruction, as all he wants is to get stronger. Eventually, the group is notified by Bulma about Frieza's return and that his power has grown immensely. The Z-Fighters on Earth power up so Goku can sense their energy, and he (with Vegeta) teleports to Earth using Instant Transmission.

<p>Upon arriving, they meet Frieza face-to-face, realizing he has gotten stronger, but Goku says he has gotten stronger, as well. Frieza immediately takes his Final Form, and Goku prepares to fight him using the <a href="/wiki/God-like_Saiyan" class="mw-redirect" title="God-like Saiyan">power of Super Saiyan God</a>. Goku has the upper hand in the battle - managing to avoid even taking a single scratch, and he pushes back Frieza's <a href="/wiki/Golden_Death_Ball" title="Golden Death Ball">Golden Death Ball</a> with his own <a href="/wiki/God_Kamehameha" title="God Kamehameha">God Kamehameha</a>.

<p>Frieza then becomes <a href="/wiki/Golden_Frieza" title="Golden Frieza">Golden Frieza</a>, and Goku is shocked to see that Frieza's power skyrocketed to the point that it has surpassed his own. As Goku fights Frieza, he realizes Frieza is too strong for him to fight on par with, but he and Vegeta soon realize that Frieza's power is decreasing due not being able to handle his new form's strain. During the fight, Goku slowly gains the upper hand as Frieza's power eventually drops to a level below his. Goku offers Frieza a chance to leave and train with his new power, but Frieza grows frustrated and continues to fight. When Goku has Frieza cornered, he is <a href="/wiki/Bad_Ring_Laser" title="Bad Ring Laser">shot</a> from behind by <a href="/wiki/Sorbet" title="Sorbet">Sorbet</a>, Frieza's underling. Whis had explained to Goku that he lets his guard down which makes him easy to take down with an unexpected attack, and due to the attack from behind, Goku is mortally wounded and left at Frieza's mercy.

While Broly puts further strain and pressure on Vegeta as the fight continues, Goku takes off his coat and decides it's time for him to fight Broly.

<p>Goku transforms into a <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God" title="Super Saiyan God">Super Saiyan God</a> and <a href="/wiki/God_Bind" title="God Bind">paralyzes</a> Broly long enough to talk some sense into him. Goku's attempt at resolving the conflict peacefully appears to be having an effect, and Broly seems to calm down. However, the effect is shortlived until Broly suddenly loses his composure and gets angry enough to finally break Goku's hold on him. He manages to reverse and mimic Goku's God Bind technique but Goku manages to absorb the energy and escape and continues on with the battle. As the fighting progresses, Broly is steadily increasing in power and before long the battle becomes completely one sided in Broly's favor.

With dramatically greater power than before, Goku starts to steadily gain the advantage in the fight.

Goku then requests to see how strong Z has become and engages him in a battle, the two are fairly equal in their base forms, so Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan. Z immediately takes on his Super Neko Majin form as a counter. However Goku pulls out a cat toy, which Z cannot resist. Goku reveals that the fight was a farce, and that he actually just wanted to test how cat-like Z was. He then reveals that there is a foe that he and his family could not deal with.

After Demigra's escape from the Crack of Time, the Future Warrior is forced to fight the revived Buu, Cell, and Frieza. Chronoa then calls for Goku's help, in which he helps the Future Warrior defeat Buu, Cell, and Frieza, and the brainwashed Gotenks, Gohan, and Vegeta. After the Future Warrior returns to the Time Nest, he finds that Demigra has taken over Tokitoki City, and has brainwashed Trunks into doing his dirty work. Once Trunks was reverted to normal, Goku finds his way to the Time Nest. Due to his earlier transformation into a Super Saiyan God, he was immune to Demigra's magic. After Demigra's defeat, he escapes to the Time Next, and Goku uses Instant Transmission and brings everyone back to his location, the Time Vault. Demigra is angered and tries to destroy the Time Vault, despite Chronoa's warning. The Future Warrior and Super Saiyan 3 Goku charge at him, but Demigra fires spears at them both. One impales and kills the Future Warrior, while four of them trap Goku in an electrified force field. Then the Future Warrior (apparently from a different timeline) appears and destroys Goku's electrified gate. After the Future Warrior enters the portal that Demigra escaped to, Goku struggles to stop the gigantic energy ball from destroying Tokitoki.
</p><p>Goku stops the giant ball from destroying Tokitoki, and uses Instant Transmission to catch up to Demigra and the Future Warrior in the Crack of Time. They fight Demigra in his final form, and finish him off with a combined Kamehameha. Once Demigra is defeated, Goku and the Future Warrior return to the Time Nest, where Trunks and Chronoa are relieved to see them. Goku then challenges the Future Warrior to a fight, where he/she gladly accepted. The Supreme Kai then stops them and tells them that fighting there would cause a disaster.
</p><p>In the aftermath, Chronoa thanks Goku for everything. Goku then replies that he should be thanking her instead, for giving him something to be excited for. Goku then leaves, but not before being welcome to return in the future.

He and Vegeta appear fighting Fu who they think is Whis. They later fight the Future Warrior and his teacher. If the teacher is Goku then the two Goku's will battle. Fu will turn one of the Goku's and Vegeta into Super Saiyan 4's with Blutz Waves and your Goku will respond by turning Super Saiyan Blue and the Goku's will battle each other, with Vegeta becoming increasingly annoyed and flustered of having to deal with two Goku's. Later if the right choices are made, Old Kai will manipulate Goku into wanting to fight Fu, as Old Kai believes Fu is responsible for everything. This will cause the Future Warrior to step in and fight in Fu's place. After the fight begins Fu will reappear and give all the energy he absorbed to the Future Warrior, which allows him to fight on par with and beat Super Saiyan Blue Goku, forcing Goku to push himself into Ultra Instinct, to which the fight was unfinished.

In the <a href="/wiki/Timespace_Rift" title="Timespace Rift">Timespace Rift</a> after <a href="/wiki/Tekka" title="Tekka">Tekka</a> teams up with Goten and Kid Trunks for the Timespace Tournament, <a href="/wiki/Ziku" title="Ziku">Ziku</a> detects Goku's ki signature and got to find him to ask him to join their team. However they learn that the signature is coming from another dimension and Tekka uses <a href="/wiki/Burst_Ki" class="mw-redirect" title="Burst Ki">Burst Ki</a> to open a hole in timespace. However instead of Adult Goku, Kid Goku appears to the shock of Tekka, Goten, and Trunks. They discover that he is Goku's younger self from the time period he was training under Kami. After introducing themselves and explaining about the Timespace Rift and tournament, Kid Goku agrees to join their team. As part of Tekka's team, Kid Goku meets various people from different timelines and eras such as older version of his friends (Bulma, Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu), his older brother Raditz, granddaughter Pan, the Ginyu Force, Frieza, his future rival Vegeta, his eldest son Gohan as a Teen and Adult, Piccolo Junior, Future Trunks, Cell, Broly, Mira, Towa, and many others as well as his adult self.
</p><p>During the main story, he meets his future adult self. Kid Goku is amazed by his older self's power and wants to become as strong as him, while Adult Goku envies his younger self due to the many battles and tough opponents he will encounter. Additionally, Kid Goku also encounters Broly in Area 4F and at one point Goku humorously asks why so many people know him.
</p><p>In addition to meeting his older brother, sons, and granddaughter, Kid Goku also meets both of his parents in two separate Sub-Events. In <i>Sub-Event</i>: "<i>Father's Fist</i>", Goku and Tekka's Team meet Bardock in Area F4 of the Timespace Rift. At first Bardock does not realize Goku is Kakarot until Goku asks if he had met him somewhere before, though Bardock decides to keep his true identity as his father from Goku, who is implied to have subconsciously remembered his father's scent though due to his amnesia, Goku only remembers it is a familiar scent like his Grandpa Gohan's indicating that he remembers the scent is from when he was young. Bardock offers to spar with Tekka's Team which Goku excitedly accepts. Tekka's Team defeat Bardock by dealing a certain amount of damage in a certain amount of time. Afterwards Goku is amazed by Bardock's power and the two continue to spar a bit. Goku is amazed by Bardock's power and Bardock asks Goku to allow him to accompany Tekka's Team so he can train him. Thinking to himself, Bardock wishes for his son to grow stronger than even him.
</p><p>In <i>Sub-Event</i>: "<i>An Unlikely Pair</i>", his mother Gine ends up traveling through a time hole Tekka opens up. She is at first confused by her new surroundings and Pan notices Gine is a Saiyan. When Goku points out she has a tail like him, Gine recognizes her son and calls him by his birth name. Goku asks if they have ever met before, causing Gine to almost reveal she is his mother, but decides to keep her identity a secret from him. Flustered by the encounter, Gine leaves abruptly and Pan notices her odd behavior. Later Goku and the team come to her defense and defeat the group attacking her. While Goku is checking on Gine to see if she is okay. Gine asks if she can accompany them and Tekka agrees. Goku is about to welcome her when he realizes he doesn't know her name and she reveals her name which Goku calls her by due to still being unaware she is his birth mother. It is the first time in a Dragon Ball game in which Goku meets and encounters both his parents and older brother, though he is only aware of his familial relationship with Raditz.

His natural talent for battle along with his unwavering drive have taken his power to unprecedented levels to the point of reaching and rivaling the domain of the <a href="/wiki/God_of_Destruction" title="God of Destruction">Gods of Destruction</a>. Ultimately, Goku's immeasurable potential has made him believed to be incomparable and even unbeatable for any other fighter when he is at his absolute peak.
</p><p>As an infant, he could drag large rocks tied to him while pursuing food and resist his adoptive <a href="/wiki/Grandpa_Gohan" title="Grandpa Gohan">grandpa's</a> attempts to hold him down. When first meeting <a href="/wiki/Bulma" title="Bulma">Bulma</a>, he was unfazed when rundown by her car and shot, quickly picking up and throwing her car with her in it. He defeated a <a href="/wiki/Pteranodon" class="mw-redirect" title="Pteranodon">Pteranodon</a>, a pack of <a href="/wiki/Wolves" class="mw-redirect" title="Wolves">wolves</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Bear_Thief" title="Bear Thief">Bear Thief</a> with ease. When meeting <a href="/wiki/Yamcha" title="Yamcha">Yamcha</a>, Goku fought on par with the bandit despite being weakened from hunger. Later, as a Great Ape, Goku effortlessly destroyed <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Pilaf" title="Emperor Pilaf">Emperor Pilaf</a>'s castle.
</p><p>While training under <a href="/wiki/Master_Roshi" title="Master Roshi">Master Roshi</a>, Goku consistently outperformed <a href="/wiki/Krillin" title="Krillin">Krillin</a>, including moving large boulders and running a 100-meter dash in 8.5 seconds. Goku and Krillin accomplished various grueling labors a day that outperformed an entire work-force of adults. By the <a href="/wiki/21st_World_Martial_Arts_Tournament" class="mw-redirect" title="21st World Martial Arts Tournament">21st World Martial Arts Tournament</a>, Goku's might could move a massive boulder. In the tournament, he breezed through the preliminaries while holding back significantly and developed various new techniques against his foes. In the finals, Goku fought on par with the seasoned veteran "<a href="/wiki/Master_Roshi" title="Master Roshi">Jackie Chun</a>" and likewise replicate practically every maneuver his opponent used on him, narrowly losing by lack of stamina after a double count-out.
</p><p>While fighting the <a href="/wiki/Red_Ribbon_Army" title="Red Ribbon Army">Red Ribbon Army</a>, Goku did not experience any serious trouble against the majority of their fighters, with only <a href="/wiki/General_Blue" title="General Blue">General Blue</a> providing any meaningful resistance through the use of his telekinetic abilities. In hand-to-hand combat, however, Goku still managed to handily come out on top. Goku had also fought on par with the <a href="/wiki/Pirate_Robot" title="Pirate Robot">Pirate Robot</a>, an ancient but powerful fighting machine, before finally defeating it with an aerial assault. 
</p><p>When facing <a href="/wiki/Mercenary_Tao" title="Mercenary Tao">Mercenary Tao</a>, Goku was toyed with by the deadly assassin and only managed to mildly hurt the foe with his Kamehameha before being defeated himself. After training with <a href="/wiki/Korin" title="Korin">Korin</a>, Goku defeated Mercenary Tao with ease, able to block Tao's <a href="/wiki/Dodon_Ray" title="Dodon Ray">Dodon Ray</a> with only mild pain. Goku then proceeded to single-handedly destroy the entire Red Ribbon Army's headquarters and defeat all of its soldiers. Even <a href="/wiki/Staff_Officer_Black" title="Staff Officer Black">Staff Officer Black</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Battle_Jacket" title="Battle Jacket">Battle Jacket</a> was beaten easily.
</p><p>To get help from <a href="/wiki/Fortuneteller_Baba" title="Fortuneteller Baba">Fortuneteller Baba</a>, Goku faced and defeated her supernatural foes including <a href="/wiki/Bandages_the_Mummy" title="Bandages the Mummy">Bandages the Mummy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spike_the_Devil_Man" title="Spike the Devil Man">Spike the Devil Man</a> with mild effort. He then fought on par with the resurrected Grandpa Gohan, who resorted to grabbing Goku's tail to get an advantage.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/World_Martial_Arts_Tournament#22nd" title="World Martial Arts Tournament">22nd World Martial Arts tournament</a>, Goku defeated a former champion in <a href="/wiki/King_Chappa" title="King Chappa">King Chappa</a> in the preliminaries. He gradually overwhelmed Krillin, even taking Krillin's Kamehameha with a single hand. As Krillin attempted to stop Goku by grabbing his tail, Goku is revealed to have trained it to be as strong as the rest of his body. Goku then defeated Krillin too fast for anyone but <a href="/wiki/Tien_Shinhan" title="Tien Shinhan">Tien</a> to see. Against Tien in the finals, Goku proved able to counter virtually everything Tien used on him, forcing him to instead rely on a count-out by destroying the ring while he flew.
</p><p>Against <a href="/wiki/Tambourine" title="Tambourine">Tambourine</a>, Goku was bested due to his exhaustion and hunger after the aforementioned tournament. Once he regained his strength, however, Goku easily defeated and killed the monster. Almost immediately after, Goku was confronted by the weakened, aged <a href="/wiki/King_Piccolo" title="King Piccolo">King Piccolo</a> himself and dominated at first due to taking him by surprise. However, once King Piccolo got serious, he soundly defeated Goku and easily withstood his Kamehameha. After drinking the <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Divine_Water" title="Ultra Divine Water">Ultra Divine Water</a>, Goku's <a href="/wiki/Unlock_Potential" title="Unlock Potential">potential was unlocked</a>, enabling him to easily defeat <a href="/wiki/Drum" title="Drum">Drum</a>, King Piccolo's most powerful warrior who had effortlessly beaten Tien, and fight on par with King Piccolo himself, who was restored to his prime and eventually defeated him. After training under <a href="/wiki/Mr._Popo" title="Mr. Popo">Mr. Popo</a> for three years, Goku's all-around performance increased remarkably to surpass his teachers. In the <a href="/wiki/23rd_World_Martial_Arts_Tournament" class="mw-redirect" title="23rd World Martial Arts Tournament">23rd World Martial Arts Tournament</a>, with weighted clothes, he effortlessly made it to the semi-finals. Once removing his weighted clothes, Goku's speed proved too great for Tien to even perceive and quickly defeated Tien. In the finals, Goku noticeably outfights King Piccolo's stronger reincarnation, <a href="/wiki/Piccolo" title="Piccolo">Piccolo Junior</a>, gradually wearing down the foe to ultimately defeat him and become acknowledged as the strongest in the world.
</p><p>At the start of Dragon Ball Z, while Goku's might was extraordinary by human standards, it was revealed that by even Low-level Saiyan standards, Goku's power was a somewhat pitiful level of 334, making him the weakest Saiyan alive at that point. He was outclassed by his older brother <a href="/wiki/Raditz" title="Raditz">Raditz</a>, considered a mid-class warrior himself. Despite aid from Piccolo, he only managed to defeat Raditz by dying along with him after taking Piccolo's <a href="/wiki/Special_Beam_Cannon" title="Special Beam Cannon">blast</a>. After training with <a href="/wiki/King_Kai" title="King Kai">King Kai</a>, Goku gained a power level of 5,000 (when supressed) to 8,000 (or <a href="/wiki/It%27s_Over_9000!" title="It&#39;s Over 9000!">9000</a>), easily defeating <a href="/wiki/Nappa" title="Nappa">Nappa</a>, the Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="/wiki/Saiyan_Army" title="Saiyan Army">Saiyan Army</a>. He fought on par with <a href="/wiki/Vegeta" title="Vegeta">Vegeta</a>, a Super Elite warrior, although he needed to use Kaio-Ken x3 in order to overpower the Saiyan prince.
</p><p>After healing from his fight with Great Ape Vegeta and training at x100 Earth's gravity, Goku's power far exceeded Saiyan standards, easily defeating Ginyu Force members <a href="/wiki/Recoome" title="Recoome">Recoome</a> and <a href="/wiki/Burter" title="Burter">Burter</a>, the former of whom pummeled Vegeta and Gohan, and fight on par with <a href="/wiki/Captain_Ginyu" title="Captain Ginyu">Captain Ginyu</a> himself. After healing from his <a href="/wiki/Body_Change" title="Body Change">Body Change</a> experience, Goku's power increased immensely, and through <a href="/wiki/Biting" title="Biting">various tactics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Twin_Dragon_Shot" title="Twin Dragon Shot">newfound strategies</a>, forced the powerful tyrant <a href="/wiki/Frieza" title="Frieza">Frieza</a> to fight seriously at 50% of his true power. Only when he used Kaio-ken x20, could Goku land an attack on Frieza at 50% power, and even then, his attack failed to give Frieza any major damage. After transforming into a <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan" title="Super Saiyan">Super Saiyan</a>, Goku completely outmatched Frieza at 100% power, calmly dominating the foe once fighting seriously.
</p><p>After training with the <a href="/wiki/Yardrat" title="Yardrat">Yardrats</a>, Goku's power increased enough to defeat both Mecha Frieza and <a href="/wiki/King_Cold" title="King Cold">King Cold</a>, as he <a href="/wiki/Future_Goku" title="Future Goku">originally</a> would have if not been for <a href="/wiki/Future_Trunks" title="Future Trunks">Future Trunks</a> doing so. In their brief spar as Super Saiyans, Goku effortlessly deflected all of Future Trunks' sword attacks with a finger, leaving the hybrid in awe, albeit Goku noted that Future Trunks wasn't fighting seriously. After training for three years to prepare for the Androids, Goku, at Super Saiyan, easily dominated <a href="/wiki/Android_19" title="Android 19">Android 19</a> and would have defeated him had the <a href="/wiki/Heart_virus" class="mw-redirect" title="Heart virus">heart virus</a> not hindered him. After training in the <a href="/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber" title="Hyperbolic Time Chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a>, Super Saiyan Goku showed far more power than any of his allies, all while at less than half his might. Against <a href="/wiki/Cell" title="Cell">Cell</a>, Goku fought on par with a restrained Perfect Cell, a feat no one could match but <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_2" title="Super Saiyan 2">Super Saiyan 2</a> Gohan.
</p><p>In the anime, Goku fought in the <a href="/wiki/Other_World_Tournament" title="Other World Tournament">Other World Tournament</a> against the greatest warriors in the history of Universe 7 with countless millennia-worth of experience each and reached the finals against <a href="/wiki/Pikkon" title="Pikkon">Pikkon</a>, seemingly the mightiest warrior of Other World.

<p>Seven years later, base Goku easily carried eight tons of weighted clothing for training and 40 tons as a Super Saiyan. Base Goku easily fended off <a href="/wiki/Yakon" title="Yakon">Yakon</a>, even void of sight from Yakon's pitch-black world. As Super Saiyan, Goku was noted to have 3,000 <a href="/wiki/Kili" title="Kili">kili</a> - power to destroy several planets. Goku also said he can defeat <a href="/wiki/Dabura" title="Dabura">Dabura</a>, a foe who is the strongest in the Demon Realm, without too much difficulty. Vegeta noted that Super Saiyan 2 Goku surpassed Gohan's power when he defeated Super Perfect Cell. With just transforming into <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_3" title="Super Saiyan 3">Super Saiyan 3</a>, Goku causes worldwide earthquakes with Tien worrying Goku could destroy the planet by the sheer weight of his power. Goku's ki in his Super Saiyan 3 form is potent enough to be sensed by beings in the Sacred World of the Kais all the way from Earth. Against <a href="/wiki/Innocent_Buu" title="Innocent Buu">Buu</a>, despite the Majin's limitless resilience and unpredictable nature, Super Saiyan 3 Goku could fight on par with and continuously pressure him. Ultimately, Goku admitted to be holding back considerably as Super Saiyan 3's intensity was draining Goku's time in the Living World and probably could have defeated him if he had tried.
</p><p>In the anime, Goku manages to hold his own against <a href="/wiki/Super_Buu" title="Super Buu">Super Buu</a> (Gotenks absorbed) as Super Saiyan 3. Goku proved able to fight nearly on par with the <a href="/wiki/Fake_Z_Fighters" title="Fake Z Fighters">Ultimate Gohan (Clone)</a> in his base form, and quickly overwhelmed him with Super Saiyan. Later, Super Saiyan 2 Goku fended off <a href="/wiki/Kid_Buu" title="Kid Buu">Kid Buu</a> for an extended period of time, even parting a mountain with his bare fists. Once using Super Saiyan 3, Goku initially pressured the Majin until he began tiring against Buu's near-limitless healing. It was noted that his full power could wipe out the Majin. However, he had trouble gathering the necessary energy since his living body hadn't adapted to the form yet.
</p><p>At the very beginning of the manga version of the <a href="/wiki/God_of_Destruction_Beerus_Saga" title="God of Destruction Beerus Saga">God of Destruction Beerus Saga</a>, Goku has a <a href="/wiki/Image_Training" title="Image Training">mental battle</a> with his three strongest enemies from the original series: Frieza, Cell, and Kid Buu. Using Super Saiyan alone, Goku effortlessly defeats Frieza and Cell in their strongest forms. Before he can face Kid Buu, still as a Super Saiyan, he is suddenly interrupted when he hears Goten crashing his tractor.
</p><p>Upon meeting base Goku, <a href="/wiki/Beerus" title="Beerus">Beerus</a> highly doubts Goku could defeat Frieza. In the anime, it is stated by Beerus that, even as a Super Saiyan, Goku is only slightly stronger than Frieza,<sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">&#91;180&#93;</a></sup> while in the manga Beerus does not acknowledge Goku's ability to defeat Frieza until he has experienced his Super Saiyan 2 form's power.<sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">&#91;181&#93;</a></sup> When using Super Saiyan 3, Goku's power impressed Beerus and Whis, albeit he was still utterly defeated by two playful strikes from Beerus. After Goku attained <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God" title="Super Saiyan God">Super Saiyan God</a>, Goku is strong enough to face Beerus and inflict some damage, to which their fight caused the universe to start crumbling from the massive energy they exerted. After Super Saiyan God form's time limit ended in the anime, Goku reverted to Super Saiyan, but was still able to compete against Beerus as he managed to absorb the godly power, with it being noted that he had surpassed Super Saiyan God by evolving. After reverting to his base form, Goku managed to destroy the <a href="/wiki/Sphere_of_Destruction" class="mw-redirect" title="Sphere of Destruction">Sphere of Destruction</a> he and Beerus had created, though it used up all of his power to do so.
</p><p>While Goku trained under <a href="/wiki/Whis" title="Whis">Whis</a>, in the anime, Whis noted that Goku was only on the lowest levels of godly power. At this point, base Goku could survive an unrestrained <i>ki</i> blast from Beerus. In the anime, base Goku and Final Form Frieza fighting was noted by Krillin and Gohan to move too fast to be seen. Also, Goku pressured Frieza in his strengthened true form, whose first form easily defeated Super Saiyan Gohan.<sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">&#91;182&#93;</a></sup> Despite then revealing <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Blue" title="Super Saiyan Blue">Super Saiyan Blue</a>, Goku was completely outmatched by the tyrant's new <a href="/wiki/Golden_Frieza" title="Golden Frieza">Golden form</a> and had to rely on his superior stamina to outlast Frieza, whose lack of proper control over the new form exhausted him. Once he was drained, Goku soundly defeated his nemesis with limited effort.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Tournament_of_Destroyers" title="Tournament of Destroyers">Tournament of Destroyers</a>, Goku briefly struggled against <a href="/wiki/Botamo" title="Botamo">Botamo</a>'s unusual body, forcing him to instead rely on strategy to defeat him and then went on to dominate <a href="/wiki/Frost" title="Frost">Frost</a>, who resorted to poisoning the Saiyan in an attempt to achieve victory. Against <a href="/wiki/Hit" title="Hit">Hit</a>, base Goku held his own and began pressuring Hit as he adapted to his <a href="/wiki/Time-Skip" title="Time-Skip">Time-Skip</a> assault. In the anime, his Super Saiyan Blue overwhelmed the assassin's full power. This forced Hit to <a href="/wiki/Pure_Progress" title="Pure Progress">imprint and improve</a> his battle prowess to counter Goku, which in turn drove Goku to use <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Blue_Kaio-ken" title="Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken">x10 Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken</a>, allowing him to outmatch the assassin's improved Time-Skip. In the manga, Super Saiyan Goku outmatched Hit until Hit's tactics retained more stamina than Goku. Super Saiyan God Goku was on par with Hit's full power and immune to the Time-Skip. With Super Saiyan Blue, Goku broke the Time-Skip completely.
</p><p>In the anime, when meeting <a href="/wiki/Goku_Black" title="Goku Black">Goku Black</a> in the present timeline, Super Saiyan 2 Goku is able to fight on par with him. Later, when Super Saiyan 2 Goku fights <a href="/wiki/Zamasu" title="Zamasu">Zamasu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gowasu" title="Gowasu">Gowasu</a> notes that Goku's power is in the same realm as a destroyer's (although Beerus is offended by this statement), having gradually overwhelmed and defeated Zamasu. Super Saiyan Blue Goku fought on par with <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Ros%C3%A9" title="Super Saiyan Rosé">Super Saiyan Rosé</a> Black, occasionally outmaneuvering him, but was critically hurt by Black's <a href="/wiki/Black_Kamehameha" title="Black Kamehameha">Black Kamehameha</a> while held down by Future Zamasu. Upon learning Goku Black killed his family in the previous timeline, despite the hole in his chest, an enraged Goku overwhelmed Goku Black and <a href="/wiki/Future_Zamasu" title="Future Zamasu">Future Zamasu</a> simultaneously. Goku also proceeded to briefly overwhelm Fused Zamasu using his Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken despite his injured arms.
</p><p>In the manga, during Vegeta's battle with Goku Black, Future Trunks states that Goku has trained and pushed his body to it's absolute limit to the point that he cannot get any stronger. Goku also managed to overwhelm Fused Zamasu using <a href="/wiki/Perfected_Super_Saiyan_Blue" title="Perfected Super Saiyan Blue">Perfected Super Saiyan Blue</a>.
</p><p>In the anime, once Goku faced Hit again, he was overwhelmed by Hit's new skillset, mainly Hit's ability to phase through attacks. During the second round, Goku quickly realized the truth of his techniques and adjusted, able to overpower Hit with only Super Saiyan Blue, noting that Hit's Time-Skip techniques would no longer affect him. After which, Goku's sheer energy shattered Hit's <a href="/wiki/Tides_of_Time" title="Tides of Time">Tides of Time</a> pocket dimension and the fight ended in a stalemate.
</p><p>In the anime, during the <a href="/wiki/Zeno_Expo" title="Zeno Expo">Zeno Expo</a>, base Goku matched <a href="/wiki/Bergamo" title="Bergamo">Bergamo</a>, the strongest warrior of <a href="/wiki/Universe_9" title="Universe 9">Universe 9</a>. With Super Saiyan, he outpaced the giant Bergamo before defeating him with Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken, to which the gathered deities noted that Goku's power rivaled the gods. Afterwards, Super Saiyan Blue Goku fought against <a href="/wiki/Top" title="Top">Top</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Universe_11" title="Universe 11">Universe 11</a> candidate for the God of Destruction, and gradually overwhelmed him. In the manga, base Goku stayed conscious from <a href="/wiki/Rumsshi" title="Rumsshi">Rumsshi</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Battle_Roar" title="Battle Roar">Battle Roar</a>, which knocked out all the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Kai_(position)" title="Supreme Kai (position)">Supreme Kais</a> present.
</p><p>During recruitment for <a href="/wiki/Team_Universe_7" title="Team Universe 7">Team Universe 7</a> in the anime, base Goku matched the highly strengthened Shape-Up <a href="/wiki/Good_Buu" title="Good Buu">Good Buu</a> but is defeated by ring out. Fought mostly on par with the hugely powered up <a href="/wiki/Android_17" title="Android 17">Android 17</a>, but both agreed that the Saiyan was still holding back considerably. Against Gohan's Potential Unleashed state, Goku fought on par with Super Saiyan Blue and then used the Kaio-ken to defeat Gohan instantly. Base Goku withstood Sidra's <a href="/wiki/Energy_of_Destruction" title="Energy of Destruction">Energy of Destruction</a>, though he was unable to get control over it, requiring Beerus' aid and at Super Saiyan Blue, had a brief exchange with Golden Frieza and proved his equal despite his tremendous power increase.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Tournament_of_Power" title="Tournament of Power">Tournament of Power</a>, numerous deities, acknowledge Goku as the most powerful warrior of Universe 7 with at least a few of them considering him the greatest threat after <a href="/wiki/Jiren" title="Jiren">Jiren</a>. All throughout, base Goku held his own against multiple opponents such as the <a href="/wiki/Trio_of_Danger" title="Trio of Danger">Trio of Danger</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Universe_3" title="Universe 3">Universe 3</a> robots <a href="/wiki/Koitsukai" title="Koitsukai">Koitsukai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Panc%C3%A9a" title="Pancéa">Pancéa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Borareta" title="Borareta">Borareta</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Universe_6" title="Universe 6">Universe 6</a> Saiyan <a href="/wiki/Caulifla" title="Caulifla">Caulifla</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Universe_2" title="Universe 2">Universe 2</a> warriors <a href="/wiki/Ribrianne" title="Ribrianne">Ribrianne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roasie" title="Roasie">Roasie</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zarbuto" title="Zarbuto">Zarbuto</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rabanra" title="Rabanra">Rabanra</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Zirloin" title="Zirloin">Zirloin</a> with his power, skill and determination. This is made all the more impressive by the fact that during at least half of these encounters, he was extremely exhausted. At Super-Saiyan Blue, Goku was outmatched by only <a href="/wiki/Kefla" title="Kefla">Kefla</a> and Jiren. In the anime, even with X20 Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken, Goku stood no chance against Jiren. In the manga, Goku pushed his body well-beyond the normal limits of Perfected Super Saiyan Blue to utilize the Kaio-ken, using this increase in power to momentarily overwhelm Jiren. However, the strain quickly caught up, allowing Jiren to rebound unfazed.
</p><p>Goku eventually gained <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Instinct_Sign" title="Ultra Instinct Sign">Ultra Instinct Sign</a> which allowed him to hold his own against Jiren. In this state, Goku's <i>ki</i> shook the entire <a href="/wiki/Null_Realm" title="Null Realm">Null Realm</a>, a realm of infinite size. Against Top and <a href="/wiki/Dyspo" title="Dyspo">Dyspo</a>, he <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Instinct_(ability)" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultra Instinct (ability)">nonchalantly blocked their simultaneous assault and dodged the former's Justice Flash</a>. He later eliminated Kefla while in her <a href="/wiki/Legendary_Super_Saiyan_2" title="Legendary Super Saiyan 2">Super Saiyan 2</a> form. In the final one-on-one confrontation against Jiren, Goku achieved Ultra Instinct Sign again and began to overpower Jiren. Eventually Goku mastered Ultra Instinct, leaving all the present deities observing in awe. He then easily overwhelmed Jiren until he unleashed his hidden power, but ultimately Goku was still able to gain an advantage over Jiren until his body broke down. In the manga, upon perfecting Ultra Instinct Goku quickly overpowered and almost eliminated Jiren. However Jiren noted that Goku did not possess "true strength" and was simply exploiting openings, going to his full power Jiren then went on to pressure Goku, with his lack of training in Ultra Instinct making him quickly lose stamina and drop back to base form. Goku teamed up with Vegeta against the battered Jiren, overpowering the foe from their synchronized assault - Goku and Vegeta's combination proving greater than the sum of it's parts. Goku and Vegeta's combined Kamehameha/Gamma Burst Flash was so powerful it warped the entire Null Realm - changing it's color - and made everyone in the stands brace themselves, though it still could not eliminate the Jiren, who had achieved a <a href="/wiki/Super_Full_Power" title="Super Full Power">further power up</a>.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Patrol_Prisoner_Saga" title="Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga">Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga</a>, after training with <a href="/wiki/Merus" title="Merus">Merus</a>, his power grew tremendously to amaze his Earth-bound allies. Goku easily defeated the <a href="/wiki/Miza_Iwaza_Kikaza_Fusion" title="Miza Iwaza Kikaza Fusion">fusion of Miza, Iwaza and Kikaza</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zauyogi" title="Zauyogi">Zauyogi</a> with a single blow each and calmly overwhelmed <a href="/wiki/Saganbo" title="Saganbo">Saganbo</a> despite the immense boost of power gained from <a href="/wiki/Moro" title="Moro">Moro</a>. Even as the latter began to overdose on Moro's power, Perfected Super Saiyan Blue let Goku easily fend the foe off.
</p><p>Against Moro, Goku showed the fruition of his training, able to access Ultra Instinct Sign at will. With it, he gained an advantage over the wizard, able to evade Moro's energy absorption power and pressure Moro onto the defense. However, once Moro unleashed his full power, he proved able to fight on equal footing with Goku, able to bypass Goku's automatic defenses. It is noted by Merus and Whis that Ultra Instinct Sign is an unstable state that will quickly drain Goku's stamina, to which Moro soon had a commanding lead due to Goku's speed dropping. Goku was able to enter a <a href="/wiki/Powerhouse" title="Powerhouse">Powerhouse</a> state and despite landing powerful blows, it robbed Goku of what little he still had of Ultra Instinct Sign's agility, allowing Moro to obtain victory. After Moro absorbed <a href="/wiki/Seven-Three" title="Seven-Three">Seven-Three</a>, Moro transformed and shattered his previous limitations. Despite this, Blue Kaio-ken Goku was able to momentarily overwhelm Moro with a Kamehameha, blasting off Moro's arm, however his efforts were quickly made pointless, as Moro regenerated his arm and impaled Goku through the chest with it. Dende noted that it would be difficult to heal Goku due to his <i>ki</i> having reached god-level.
</p><p>Later, upon witnessing Merus' sacrifice, Goku was able to perfectly and consciously access the completed Ultra Instinct state. The power he wielded allowed Goku to effortlessly outmaneuver and maim the wizard, his very strikes causing shockwaves that rattled the entire planet. Goku newfound power compared to Moro at his peak made the wizard break his own hand when punching Goku's chest. Upon Moro replicating Merus' power, despite physically being equal, Goku superior experience with Ultra Instinct allowed him to ultimately outmaneuver Moro and overtax his foe's body until Moro was forced to merge with the Earth to stabilize his newly-acquired divine power. In this state, Goku was quickly overwhelmed because Moro was absorbing the life force of everyone on the planet. However, once he restored all of his divine power, Goku was finally able to dominated the warlock and finally obliterated him by destroying his source of power.
</p><p>By the <a href="/wiki/Granolah_the_Survivor_Saga" title="Granolah the Survivor Saga">Granolah the Survivor Saga</a>, Goku's instant and perfect access of Ultra Instinct made Whis put actual effort in sparring with Goku, getting into a serious stance. Despite this, Whis notes that Goku's execution of Ultra Instinct is still only basic compared to a fully-trained Angel, and he is easily overpowered by Whis. When Goku asked Whis if he knew of anyone in Universe 7 stronger than he and Vegeta, Whis noted that he did not.
</p><p>After arriving on the planet Cereal, both Goku and Vegeta were immediately shot at by Granola. The blasts were so accurate base Goku and Vegeta were barely dodging them and thus Goku used Ultra Instinct in his base form to dodge them better but Goku still hasn't perfected using Ultra Instinct in his base form and thus was struck by a blast from Granolah in his vital point behind neck. The hit was strong enough to knock out base Goku and Vegeta had to give him a Senzu Bean to get him back up. When starting to fight Granolah one on one Goku transforms into Super Saiyan God to fight him. Goku, even in his Super Saiyan God form is forced on the defensive and faces trouble finding an opening to attack Granolah. Goku then started using Ultra Instinct in his Super Saiyan God form to dodge Gronolah's attack better. Despite Ultra instinct being more accurate in his Super Saiyan God form Goku still got hit in his vital point by Granolah and knocked him out of his Super Saiyan God form. Unlike before, Goku was able to get back up without using a Senzu Bean. Goku then transformed into Super Saiyan Blue form and is able to fight on par with powered up Granolah. Though Goku is beginning to struggle and is forced to use a conjunction of Blue and Ultra Instinct and he is able to evade most of Granolah's attacks and used a Instant Kamehameha damaging the former before getting hit in a vital point forcing him to use Perfected Ultra Instinct. With Perfected Ultra Instinct, Goku is able to swiftly overwhelm Granolah with the latter not able to land blows albeit a fake one with his power being split and even then he had to rely on Ultra Instinct's accuracy to drop.  
</p><p>Upon recovering enough, Goku's adapted to the attack patterns of Granolah, able to anticipate how and where Granolah would strike. With this, Perfected Super Saiyan Blue Goku was able to avoid any vital damage and endure the blunt of the attacks to counter Granolah. Soon however, Granolah was able to wear Goku down enough to overwhelm him. After recovering enough, whereas before he was easily overpowered by Unlocked Potential <a href="/wiki/Gas" title="Gas">Gas</a>, Perfected Super Saiyan Blue Goku was able to hold his own and trade blows against Awakened Gas. Ultimately however, Goku was pressured too much, forcing him to lure Gas away from the planet to regroup.

While hunting for the Black Star Dragon Balls, he fights and overpowers base <a href="/wiki/General_Rilldo" title="General Rilldo">Rilldo</a>, who is stated to have greater power than Majin Buu's.

<dl><dt>Statements by authors and guidebooks</dt></dl>
<p>As a baby, Goku had a power level of 2, which is very low for even a low-level Saiyan. By age 11, his power was 10. Great Ape Goku was described as having destructive power similar to that of a battleship's main gun.<sup id="cite_ref-Daiz7_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Daiz7-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> In the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament, Goku's power became 180. After drinking the Ultra Divine Water to combat King Piccolo, Goku's power level increased to 260. During his battle with Frieza on Namek, Goku's power leaps to 3,000,000 thanks to Saiyan Power.
</p><p>It was stated in <i>Daizenshuu 2</i> that during his battle with Piccolo, his Super Kamehameha is stronger than the <a href="/wiki/Moon-Destroying_Kamehameha" title="Moon-Destroying Kamehameha"> one used to shatter the moon</a>.
</p><p>The movie pamphlet for <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_The_Tree_of_Might" title="Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might">Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might</a></i> states that Goku's power level during <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_World%27s_Strongest" class="mw-redirect" title="Dragon Ball Z: World&#39;s Strongest">Dragon Ball Z: World's Strongest</a></i> is 10,000. According to author Akira Toriyama, during <i>Battle of Gods</i>, in terms of power, Goku as Super Saiyan God would be a 6, Beerus would be a 10, and Whis would be a 15.<sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-185">&#91;185&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>While inside Buu, Goku could not even use 1/100 of his usual power.<sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-186">&#91;186&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>According to Akira Toriyama, Goku is the strongest in the Universe and #1 by the end of the original manga.<sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-187">&#91;187&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>According to the <a href="/wiki/Toei_Animation" title="Toei Animation">Toei</a> website Hirudegarn is equal in power to Super Saiyan 3 Goku, and Goku is not any stronger in <i>Wrath of the Dragon</i> than he was in <i>Fusion Reborn</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">&#91;188&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>According to <i>Weekly Shonen Jump</i> #20, Goku as Super Saiyan Blue in <i>Resurrection ‘F’</i> has an "overwhelming power that the world has never seen before". At the time of the Universe 6 Saga, Toyotarou considered Beerus and Whis to be an unsurpassable wall for Goku and the others, and Toriyama stated that he has no immediate plans for Goku and Vegeta to surpass neither Beerus or Whis.<sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">&#91;189&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Prior to Goku achieving <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Instinct_Sign" title="Ultra Instinct Sign">Ultra Instinct Sign</a>, Goku and Frieza were tied for the No. 1 spot on <a href="/wiki/Team_Universe_7" title="Team Universe 7">Team Universe 7</a> in terms of power.<sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">&#91;190&#93;</a></sup> In Goku's final usage of Ultra Instinct Sign, even <a href="/wiki/Beerus" title="Beerus">Beerus</a> thinks Goku might be stronger than him.<sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">&#91;191&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>By the time of <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super:_Broly" title="Dragon Ball Super: Broly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></i>, Goku is close to being a god, with Vegeta desperately trying to catch up with him. <sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-192">&#91;192&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>With the Perfected Ultra Instinct, Goku became the strongest mortal in Universe 7, until the <a href="/wiki/Granolah_the_Survivor_Saga" title="Granolah the Survivor Saga">Granolah the Survivor Saga</a> - where a warrior that rival Goku appeared.<sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">&#91;193&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Perfected Ultra Instinct Goku is the strongest iteration of Goku, surpassing his previous powerful rivals like Fused Zamasu, Jiren, Broly and Moro.<sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">&#91;194&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Toyotarou refers to Granolah, Goku and Vegeta as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd strongest in the universe, though does not elaborate on the order aside from Granolah being 1st. Toyotarou also states that Goku is still not on the level of Beerus, Whis or the Grand Minister.<sup id="cite_ref-UchiToyoInt_195-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UchiToyoInt-195">&#91;195&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p><i>Daizenshuu 2</i> and <i>The History of Trunks</i> anime comics reference Gohan's potential as being greater than Goku's.
</p><p><i>GT Perfect Files Vol.1</i> notes that the direction behind Goku being turned into a kid in <i>GT</i> was in order to make him weaker, as it was felt he had become too strong by the time he had defeated the "ultimately strong" Majin Buu, though due to eventually defeating the "ultimately strong" Baby, he became strong again after all despite having been turned in a child. However, the Super Saiyan section of the book contradicts the notion of Goku having become weaker as a child, stating that Goku seemed to still be as strong as before.
</p><p>As an adult in <i>GT</i>, at the time Goku was the "mightiest Goku who can do anything" and had gone as far as he could possibly go. After being turned into a child in <i>GT</i>, Goku is much weaker than his adult self.<sup id="cite_ref-DBQ_183-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DBQ-183">&#91;183&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Goku learns this technique while training under <a href="/wiki/King_Kai" title="King Kai">King Kai</a> after dying against Raditz. While using it and any of its multipliers, Goku's various capacities and techniques are all proportionally increased. However, the strain of using too high a multiplier and/or for too long can be dangerous and greatly damage his body. As such, he ceased using it after his gaining <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan" title="Super Saiyan">Super Saiyan</a>. While he can combine the two powers, Goku never tried this while alive as doing so could lead to near-certain death. Later, however, with his <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Blue" title="Super Saiyan Blue">Super Saiyan Blue</a>, taking advantage of his divine form's superior energy control and more naturally calm-mindedness, he was able to <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Blue_Kaio-ken" title="Super Saiyan Blue Kaio-ken">use</a> this technique more regularly.

<p>Easily Goku's most powerful techniques and arguably the strongest in the series, it allows Goku to channel <i>ki</i> from all sources of life that he can detect and focus it all into a single energy ball. It was taught to him by King Kai during his training for the upcoming battle against Vegeta and Nappa. Over time, Goku continually learned to expand the range of which he could gather energy, thereby increasing both the size and power of the Spirit Bomb. He reserves this technique as a last-ditch effort for only the most powerful of foes.

This technique allows him to teleport to any location so long as he can find an energy source to home onto. However, it also greatly extends his ability to sense energy. Noticeably in <i>Yo Son Goku</i>, he seemingly improved on the technique as transports to the radish field without sensing anyone, possibly because he had accurate enough knowledge of where it is.

<p>A technique learned from Master Roshi to battle Goku Black and Future Zamasu. It binds a target in a swirling stream of green energy before being guided into a container. It also requires a special tag to properly complete the sealing. While normally life-threatening to use, Goku's immense power lets him use this multiple times without even remotely exhausting any of his strength. The benefit of the technique is to defeat enemies they cannot or will not kill.

During the Tournament of Power, Goku unlocked a special <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Instinct_Sign" title="Ultra Instinct Sign">state</a>, enabling him to put to usage this skill. While very crude at first and only able to apply it defensively, he ultimately learned to <a href="/wiki/Perfected_Ultra_Instinct" title="Perfected Ultra Instinct">complete</a> this power to defend and attack simultaneously with optimum efficiency. With this power, he is able to instinctively and instantly react to any nearby threat in the most effective way possible.

<p>With further training from <a href="/wiki/Merus" title="Merus">Merus</a>, Goku unlocked the ability to use the ability with his own will, consciously activating the both forms at will. However, Whis has stated that Goku is on the bottom rung of level in Ultra Instinct as his accuracy with it is below his own (Whis), and the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Minister" title="Grand Minister">Grand Minister</a>'s. To which, Goku began training under Whis in learning to access the fundamentals of Ultra Instinct in base form, so as to build a better basis for when accessing the enhanced form.  After training, he becomes capable of using Ultra Instinct in his base form, though his control with it is still imperfect. He's capable of heightening his precision with Ultra Instinct with Super Saiyan God, a state that focuses on calm and methodical fighting, though even in this state, it's still imperfect, as Granolah was capable of catching him off-guard.

<p>Like all Saiyans, Goku can transform into a Great Ape when absorbing enough blutz waves, usually from looking at a full moon, while still having his tail, though not of his choosing. As a Great Ape, Goku's dormant Saiyan traits re-emerge and he becomes feral and violent. His power and senses increase 10 fold and are able to generate powerful mouth blasts. Originally, because his tail was removed permanently <a href="/wiki/Kami" title="Kami">Kami</a> when restoring the moon, Goku lost access completely to this form. However, in Dragon Ball GT, thanks to Old Kai's aid, Goku regained his tail. Also, he became able to use any <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">planetary surface</a> to focus the blutz wave to transform.

After his training under Kami, Goku could remove the Weighted portions Turtle School Uniform to increase his power level and agility due to being no longer incumbered by the heavy weights allowing him to utilize a more agile fighting style hence its name. Goku first used it during the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament and later when he confronted his brother <a href="/wiki/Raditz" title="Raditz">Raditz</a> alongside <a href="/wiki/Piccolo" title="Piccolo">Piccolo</a>. According to Raditz's Scouter, Goku's power level rose from 334 to 416 indicating the weight removal alone increased his power level by 82. This state was named in <i>Dragon Ball Legends</i> (albeit in relation to Piccolo &amp; Pikkon's use of Agile Style) where it is the "base" form used by Goku (DBL22-01S) which represents Goku from the period during which he fought Raditz.<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>Goku achieves this form in a rage after Frieza <a href="/wiki/Death_Psycho_Bomb" title="Death Psycho Bomb">killed</a> Krillin. In this form, Goku's muscle and height slight increase and his skin turns lighter. His eyes become noticeably sterner and more defined with green eyes. His hair becomes blond and stands with no loose strands. His power also generates a yellow aura. In the anime, when unleashing the full intensity of his power, Goku's aura also produces some slight electrical sparks. Goku's demeanor is greatly affected by this form, making him more aggressive and irritable. In the anime, Goku learned to access this form's raw might <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan/partial_manifestation" title="Super Saiyan/partial manifestation">without actually transforming</a> to conserve <i>ki</i>. After his fight with Beerus, Goku realizes that fully mastering this form would eventually raise his level more than his higher Super Saiyan forms, and sap less strength and <i>ki</i>. A thing to note is that in his initial appearances as a Super Saiyan, the hair looks less detailed. When he became a Super Saiyan Full Power, the hair looks incredibly detailed and nice-looking. <sup id="cite_ref-2014Saikyo6_198-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2014Saikyo6-198">&#91;198&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In Part 2 of the <a href="/wiki/Society_Survival_Saga" title="Society Survival Saga">Society Survival Saga</a>, Goku's Super Saiyan form is humorously called <b>Super Corporate Freshman</b> in a scene that parodies his first transformation from the Frieza Saga. However, Goku transforms as a result of Frieza tricking Krillin into quitting his job at DB Incorporated for a job at Frieza's company Cold Co. by making false promises. After transforming, the scene parodies Goku's speech to Frieza from the Frieza Saga, with Goku stating that society's twisted ways have sparked a rage within that has transformed him into the suited warrior of legend, Super Corporate Freshman.

<p>Realizing that the androids' power exceeds a Super Saiyan, Goku entered the Hyperbolic Time Chamber to surpass the basic Super Saiyan form. Ultimately, Goku unlocked this form after weeks of training. However, Goku realized that this form spends too much <i>ki</i> to be maintained. Rather than attempting the more arduous and time-consuming task of refining this form, Goku came to the conclusion that the basic Super Saiyan form is better suited for combat, making a plan to master it and abandon this form completely. As a result of this and discovering more powerful forms, this form is never used again.

<p>Along with Second Grade, Goku achieves this form in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. While vastly stronger than Second Grade, the power output is too intense, causing Goku's muscles to become engorged from the struggle of maintaining this unsteady power boost. This instability drained his <i>ki</i> too fast to be of use for long. It also causes an extreme drop in his speed and agility, tiring him even more and reducing his effectiveness overall. Goku noted that while much stronger than Semi-Perfect Cell, it meant nothing if he could not actually hit his foe with it. This made this form impractical against foes of any real speed. Instead of training to overcome this problem, Goku decides that simply mastering the basic Super Saiyan, feeling that it is the best way to fight and gain power. As such a result, this form is never used again.

<p>After realizing the weaknesses inherent to the higher Super Saiyan grades, Goku concluded that mastery over the basic Super Saiyan form would be more beneficial. He used the remainder of his time chamber training learning to maintain Super Saiyan for extended periods. Gradually, he overcame the heightened aggression and uneasiness that accompanies this form to feel as natural as his base form, reducing the energy drain to nothing and increasing his endurance to achieve a max output for this form without drawbacks even in regular life. Ultimately, he is able to enter, maintain, and fight in this form for as long as he desires at its full potential with no loss in efficiency or performance. In the anime, with this mastery, during the Tournament of Power, Goku - having gone well-beyond his limits - was able to flash between base and Super Saiyan to defeat Jiren alongside Frieza despite his battered and exhausted state.
</p><p>Goku is able to use Super Saiyan with the mastered energies of a god<sup id="cite_ref-XV2_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-XV2-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>, as he did to combat Beerus in <i>Battle of Gods</i>, though this power seemingly evolved into Super Saiyan Blue.

His muscles also become more defined and his aura also generates electricity surrounding his body, while the aura grows markedly larger and more vibrant.

<p>Goku's strongest form in the original manga and anime. Goku achieved this level after years of training in Other World, where he could put unlimited energy into this form.<sup id="cite_ref-Daiz2_26-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Daiz2-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> In this form, his hair reaches down to his thighs and his eyebrows vanish completely while making the forehead and eye ridges larger and more prominent. His muscle mass grows noticeable larger more defined while his eyes gain green irises. His aura also becomes rounder with larger electrical sparks. Goku first used this form against Innocent Buu during the Majin Buu Saga, where he had a slight advantage over the Majin. However, this form is extremely draining in terms of energy due to the living world having less energy to siphon. This made him tire fast and even cut Goku's time left on Earth from hours to a mere thirty minutes after using this form for a short time. When <a href="/wiki/Power_up_to_the_Very_Limit" title="Power up to the Very Limit">attempting to gather enough energy</a> to defeat Kid Buu, he was unable to sustain it as he had not taken into account the strain overcoming his living body, and soon reverted to his base state. Altogether, these heavy disadvantages make it impractical to use this form out of the afterlife and even more while alive.
</p><p>In <i>Dragon Ball Super</i>, after unlocking divine forms, Goku no longer uses this form for battle due to his higher forms giving significantly more power for less <i>ki</i>. Instead, Goku reserves it for non-serious fights where he needs to test someone like Future Trunks.

<p>Goku achieves this form with the help of the five other Saiyans, and uses it against Beerus. It is a form well-beyond <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_3" title="Super Saiyan 3">Super Saiyan 3</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">&#91;199&#93;</a></sup> exiting even Beerus<sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">&#91;200&#93;</a></sup> and forcing the Destroyer to fight relatively seriously.

His aura generates like an orange flame.<sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">&#91;202&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>Usage of this form grants various heightened capacities. He recovers at an accelerated rate and requires the most minute amount of stamina to maintain this form. It lets him fight with more finesse and grace as he instinctively predict his opponent's attacks with more efficiency. His <i>ki</i> becomes <a href="/wiki/Godly_ki" class="mw-redirect" title="Godly ki">godly</a>, allowing him to <a href="/wiki/Godly_ki_sense" class="mw-redirect" title="Godly ki sense">sense</a> other such beings and likewise can <a href="/wiki/Ki_Sense" title="Ki Sense">mask himself</a> from most entities sensing him.

</p><p>Originally, despite the incredible power, Goku soon after reverts to base form due to the form's time limit. Having adapted to the feeling of Super Saiyan God, however, Goku retained some of the power, letting him continue fighting Beerus. Through further training, Goku learned to properly access and control this residual power, ultimately restoring its full properties to access this form at any time.

When in this state, while his physical appearance remains unchanged, his <i>ki</i> can be manifested as a pure white aura. If Goku attempts to become a Super Saiyan while using this power he will instead become Super Saiyan Blue.

<p>After training with Whis, Goku learned to synchronize Super Saiyan with Super Saiyan God, causing him to become a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, more commonly known as Super Saiyan Blue. This form is identical to Super Saiyan, only with cyanish-blue hair and eyes with a blue aura shaded by some gold. The form's power is a level that well-surpasses Super Saiyan God and offers increased levels of <i>ki</i> and emotional control. Goku learns to enhance the form's power through different means, including using the <a href="/wiki/Kaio-ken" title="Kaio-ken">Kaio-ken</a> while in this form, and use intense rage to further power-up the form. 
</p><p>In the manga, Super Saiyan Blue's peak power can only be maintained for a short period, gradually decreasing in stamina from prolong use. Also, repeated use will reduce the power of this form to less than 10% capacity. In the anime the stamina flaw is nowhere near as drastic but is still present and thus Goku learned to instantly and repeatedly <a href="/wiki/Super_Saiyan_God-to-Blue_switching" title="Super Saiyan God-to-Blue switching">switch</a> between his God form and Blue form, allowing him to conserve and more quickly recover the full power of Super Saiyan Blue, letting him fight for much longer periods unhindered.
</p><p>In the manga, Goku almost altogether stopped utilizing the ordinary Super Saiyan Blue form after achieving it's perfected state.

Then the intensity of pushing his power so far beyond his normal limits ultimately causes Goku to produce a jagged aura. Goku utilized this state briefly to battle Jiren - putting up a better fight than previously at the cost of straining his body - though even this power up proved futile against Jiren's overwhelming power.

<p>In the manga, as the full potential of a Super Saiyan Blue is only usable for the first few minutes before dropping down, Goku manages to overcome this massive stamina flaw to the point where he can use the form for as long and as many times as he wants. Goku achieved this by sealing the massive overflowing power inside himself, causing his aura to completely disappear. Goku first displays his completed Super Saiyan Blue state against Fused Zamasu, with his power showing a slight advantage over the fused Shinjin, who only survived because of his immortality. This state is not without flaws. First being that this requires intense concentration and focus by the user to prevent any <i>ki</i> from leaking out of their body. Second is that even if the slightest amount of <i>ki</i>, leaking out of the body can be extremely painful for Goku. If too much leaks, it could cause the power to become unstable and explode, killing Goku.

Using the <a href="/wiki/Super_Dragon_Ball" title="Super Dragon Ball">Super Dragon Balls</a>, Zamasu swapped bodies with Goku, obtaining all the inherit powers and abilities of the Saiyan. It remains unclear if Goku obtained any of Zamasu's powers through his Shinjin body as Zamasu seemingly retained his original powers and abilities once becoming Black on top of acquiring Goku's. Regardless, Goku in Zamasu's body proved powerless against Black as he effortlessly killed Goku in only base form.

<p>A state first attained during the Tournament of Power. Originally, in the anime, Goku did this by absorbing the energy of the Spirit Bomb as a bolster to break a mental shell in the subconscious to unlock a much deeper portion of his potential. In the manga, this state is the pinnacle of Goku's martial arts training; obtained from reflecting on Master Roshi's words and demonstration of proper movement, admitting to his shame in lack of personal growth and letting go of his self-doubt. With this, Goku's physical and mental parameters are vastly augmented, ranking among the most powerful entities in all the multiverse. 
</p><p>His hair stands up somewhat, becoming more wild in shape with no loose strands. His eyes become more defined and sterner in shape, while also gaining silver irises. His aura becomes a complex silver with sparkle appearance. In this state, Goku's physical, mental, and energy parameters are vastly augmented, equally increasing his combat performance. He processes information far quicker and efficiently, letting him learn and adapt to all experiences. The highlight of this lets him <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Instinct_(ability)" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultra Instinct (ability)">automatically react</a> to all threats in the most efficient way possible, even without consciously being aware of it. This augmented growth greatly accelerates his natural improvement, constantly imprinting on his experiences to become stronger, faster, and sharper in his actions with every skirmish. In the anime, entering this state also energize him and negate all previous wounds as a battered Goku showed against <a href="/wiki/Kefla" title="Kefla">Kefla</a>.
</p><p>However, initially usage of this state is random and unstable, only accessible for short periods of time and in the most dire of situations. In the anime, by his fight against Kefla, while seemingly learning to access this state more willingly, as noted by Whis, Goku's usage is still incomplete. While his movements have become more refined, he struggles to switch his full attention on to his offense, inhibiting his attacks and techniques, requiring more time to build up energy for an assault to have sufficient power. The effort also appears to drain Goku quicker, returning him to his base form and in an exhausted state.
</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Patrol_Prisoner_Saga" title="Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga">Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga</a>, after training under the angel-in-training Merus for six months (two months in real-time), Goku could access Ultra Instinct Sign at will. In it, Goku's speed and energy control is so advanced, that most people cannot perceive his movements or energy signature respectively. He sudden reaction and nature of his movements also enable him to evade energy absorption techniques. However, as this form is still a mid-point between his natural state and the true divine power of Ultra Instinct, it is unstable and by extension, he can only maintain it for brief periods, which will drain significant amounts of energy.
</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/Universal_Conflict_Saga" title="Universal Conflict Saga">Universal Conflict Saga</a>, Goku is also shown to access this state at will, as upon entering the battlefield, he immediately used it despite no pressure on him from the battle. In the anime, his control of the form can also disrupt a corrupted foe, returning them to normal as his attack ejected <a href="/wiki/Oren" title="Oren">Oren</a> from Vegeta's body. In the manga, it is shown that surprise can cause him to lose the form, as he dropped out of it when he saw Oren-possessed Vegeta.

<p>Once understanding Whis' words behind self-movement, Goku learned to let go of all self-doubt and live in the moment. When fully synchronizing his impulses with his natural drive, Goku can subconsciously unlock the full potential of his offensive and defensive might. This culminates with Goku's silver glow consuming him, turning his hair silver and skin tone more ethereal in nature. The power in this form is vastly greater than his initial state that it completely shreds away his shirt (in the anime). In this state, Goku showed such fine control of his <i>ki</i>, able to calmly repel and contain any energy assault thrown at him. He can unleash barrages of his energy in focused shockwaves and cancel out all but the strongest of attacks. In addition, while accessing this state, Goku's body is full rejuvenated and in the manga can grow sturdier in areas in response to being attacked, even causing weaker foes to break their limbs trying to hit his body.

<p>In this Perfected Ultra Instinct state, Goku's power exceeds the Gods of Destruction. In the anime, he can also channel his rage to empower himself eve further.
</p><p>Initially however, due to Goku's lack of training, this form cannot be maintained for long. In the anime, after passing the time limit, Goku's body will give out, leaking out his energy in ravaging manner that will severely injure him as he regresses to base form. In the manga, this form quickly drains at his stamina from each exertion until finally dropping out of the form, leaving him struggling to even stand from the exhaustion. At the same time, despite learning to use this state at its fullest, Goku cannot access it at will, but rather only as an instinctual reaction to the most dire of situations.
</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Patrol_Prisoner_Saga" title="Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga">Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga</a>, during the battle against Moro on Earth, after witnessing Merus' without hesitation sacrifice his very existence to battle Moro, Goku came to fully appreciate what selflessness is all about. Taking to heart the teachings of Merus and his absolute honor, Goku became able to instantly access Ultra Instinct and deactivate it at will with no apparent drawbacks. In this state, his power is able to affect the entire planet, all while still giving off no energy signature for mortals to sense. After receiving additional power from many fighters on Earth, Goku was able to manifest a giant avatar of himself to grapple with the enlarged Moro.
</p><p>In <i>Dragon Ball Heroes</i>, during his battle against <a href="/wiki/Cumber" title="Cumber">Cumber</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Prison_Planet_Saga" title="Prison Planet Saga">Prison Planet Saga</a>, Goku has apparently grown more accustomed to using this form. While still only able to access as a live-or-die reaction to such danger, his control of it once using it was more steady, as he did not burst with as much energy upon entering it and likewise was only rendered mildly exhausted after time ran out. Later, in the <a href="/wiki/New_Space-Time_War_Saga" title="New Space-Time War Saga">New Space-Time War Saga</a>, Goku finally mastered the ability to take on Perfected Ultra Instinct at will by training in the demons' Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

<p>With the <a href="/wiki/Black_Star_Dragon_Ball" title="Black Star Dragon Ball">Black Star Dragon Balls</a>, Emperor Pilaf unintentionally wishes Goku back into an eleven-year-old child in the beginning of <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>. In this state, he is known as <b>Little Goku</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-205">&#91;205&#93;</a></sup> While as a kid, depending on the source, Goku became far more limited than he was as an adult, no longer being "the mightiest who can do anything",<sup id="cite_ref-DBQ_183-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DBQ-183">&#91;183&#93;</a></sup> though according to <i>GT Perfect Files</i> his power did not seem to drop, his stamina was weakened to the point that he was only able to hold the power of Super Saiyan 3 for but a few seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-206">&#91;206&#93;</a></sup> At the same time, it inhibited his overall efficiency in battle, making it difficult to properly use more advanced techniques he learned in later years, as his small body wasn't properly conditioned for them. With Old Kai's aid, he was able to get his tail back, which not only allowed for easy access to his normal Super Saiyan forms, but later allowed him to transform into Golden Great Ape and Super Saiyan 4. After Piccolo gives Goku all of his power, he became able to use more advanced techniques again in his child form. At the end of <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>, 100 years after the defeat of the Shadow Dragons, Goku is again seen as an adult.

<p>After being wished into a child, Goku can still transform into a Super Saiyan. However, he is unable to maintain the form for as long as he can in his adult body, though still long enough to endure a grueling battle After his tail is restored, he became able to maintain the form for as long as he can normally (in his adult body). With the later return of Goku's tail, this and his higher normal Super Saiyan forms would also make the fur of his tail turn yellow when using the said form's full power.

<p>After being wished back into a child, Goku can still transform into a Super Saiyan 3. However, he can only maintain the form for mere seconds. Goku noted this problem came from his child body being too underdeveloped. This problem was overcame by help from Old Kai to regrow his tail. This let him properly adjust to Super Saiyan 3 and conserving most of his energy reserves, enabling him to quickly enter said form and use for much longer durations. After reaching higher level, Goku stopped using Super Saiyan 3 altogether as his newer form was overall more beneficial with less drawbacks.

<p>Goku achieves this form in <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>, after Old Kai helped Goku to regrow his tail, allowing him to once again become a Great Ape. When he looks at the Earth during the Baby Saga, its sufficient substitute <a href="/wiki/Blutz_Waves" title="Blutz Waves">Blutz Waves</a> allows Goku to take the said form, and soon after combining the Great Ape form with his Super Saiyan power to create this much bigger and more powerful form. While initially as feral and violent as ever in this massive state, Goku's power proved too much for Baby-Vegeta, who previously easily defeated Super Saiyan 3 Goku. In this state Goku can unleash both strong energy blasts and fireballs from his mouth. Eventually, Pan reached Goku's consciousness, letting him regain his clarity and self-control. Upon doing so, Goku transforms into Super Saiyan 4.

As noted by Vegeta, Goku's usage of Super Saiyan 4 is unique, able to access whenever he desires without a bolster. This form's power can overcome the Black Star Dragon Balls' power changing Goku into a child, returning him to his true adult self, though this however only lasts while the form is being used. The power of this form is vastly greater to Super Saiyan 3 with less drawbacks.
</p><p>In addition, Goku's overall appearance changes yet again. His muscles become larger, and he grows considerably taller, almost as tall as Piccolo. The hair is even more wild and longer, reaching his mid-back. He gains golden-yellow irises and the pigments around his eyes become lined in red. His tail grows longer, and he gains scarlet fur covering from shoulder-to-toe, excluding chest and hands. His clothes change from his childhood garb, leaving him only dressed below the waist (excluding his armbands). His wristbands and stockings turn blue while his sash changes to a stone blue color.

<p>A special state that is obtained by gathering enough energy to push his body well-past his normal limits. Goku first discovered this state against Baby Vegeta when his Golden Great Ape form proved too powerful. To battle the mutant Tuffle, Goku acquired the combined energy from Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and Pan to unlock this state. In addition to drastically augmenting his might, it likewise equally enhances his senses, letting him react to practically any threat. He is also shown able to absorb enemy energy attacks, nullifying their damage. This state has on occasion demonstrated a radiating red glow from his entire body. In this state he surpasses all but the most powerful enemy in <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Vegito" title="Vegito">Vegito</a> is the product of a <a href="/wiki/Potara_Fusion" class="mw-redirect" title="Potara Fusion">Potara Fusion</a> between Vegeta and Goku. With the combined might of both Saiyans amplified to such immense levels, Vegito is easily one of the most powerful beings in <i>Dragon Ball</i> franchise. As it is not a fusion involving a Kai, the fusion lasts only 1 hour at most, rather than being permanent. Originally, he was formed in desperation to defeat <a href="/wiki/Super_Buu" title="Super Buu">Super Buu</a>, Vegito later reappears in <i>Dragon Ball Super</i> to fight Fused Zamasu, however, the intense power of Super Saiyan Blue Vegito proved too much for the Potara, forcing the fusion to end prematurely after only mere minutes. Goku's adaptive and creative nature along with Vegeta's calculating and tactical mind makes Vegito quite intelligent. Even his two halves balance out his personality, not being reckless and arrogant unlike Vegeta yet is more decisive and merciless in battle unlike Goku. Having the skills and battle tactics of the two warriors also makes Vegito a very versatile and well-rounded fighter himself. Old Kai mentions the innate rivalry and near-opposite nature between Goku and Vegeta makes the fusion more compatible and by extension far more powerful than usual.

<p>Gogeta is one of the most powerful characters in the franchise. Gogeta was an act of desperation to stop the powerful demon of the 12th Dragon Ball Z movie, Janemba. He later reappeared in <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>, where the fusion's newfound power was overwhelming, which proved to be a problem on both sides. While effortlessly pummeling Omega Shenron, Gogeta's existence only lasted for 10 minutes (due to the usage of Super Saiyan 4 form), as opposed to the usual 30 minutes. In <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super:_Broly" title="Dragon Ball Super: Broly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></i>, Gogeta's base power was able to compete with the Legendary Super Saiyan <a href="/wiki/Broly_(DBS)" title="Broly (DBS)">Broly</a>. Against the fully transformed foe, Gogeta's Super Saiyan Blue might was able to break down dimensional barriers and decisively wear down Broly to the point of nearly killing him. Noticeably, the sheer power of this form did not dilute the time limit for the fusion.

Just at the moment, Vegeta appeared and Goku used Instant Transmission to find Vegeta and fuse, forming Vegito. This being the case, Gokule was only a hypothetical character.

<p>The EX-Fusion between Goku and Broly. He is created during a Sub-Event where Towa takes control of both Goku and Broly to force them to fuse, though she is unable to control their resulting EX-Fusion. After they defuse, Goku reveals he allowed Towa to control him so he could see what it was like to fuse with Broly. Goku is in full control of this fusion. The form debuts in <i>Dragon Ball Fusions</i>, and also appeared as a card in <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Dokkan_Battle" title="Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle">Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle</a></i>.

Spaceships used for interstellar travel. Due to being a low-class Saiyan, Goku was sent to Earth, so that he would one day conquer it. The space pod landed somewhere in a jungle or forest, and it was there that Grandpa Gohan found Goku and adopted him. Goku also used an Attack Ball belonging to the Ginyu Force to escape the exploding Namek after his battle against Frieza, eventually using the Attack Ball to arrive on Planet Yardrat and later Earth.

A mystic yellow cloud. Originally a gift from Master Roshi, after it was destroyed by Tambourine, Goku received a replacement from Korin, who created them.

However, the cloud will only carry those void of any negative thoughts. All others will instantly pass through it like any cloud.

<p>Goku has often been deemed a positive role model for children throughout Japan. In June 1988, Goku and other <i>Dragon Ball</i> characters were featured in two PSA shorts. The first short was entitled "The Goku Traffic Safety" (悟空の交通安全, <i>Gokū no Kōtsū Anzen</i>) where Goku is taught the importance of obeying traffic safety by others. The second was called "<a href="/wiki/Goku%27s_Fire_Brigade" title="Goku&#39;s Fire Brigade">Goku's Fire Brigade</a>" where he teaches two children the importance of fire safety; this short is notable for featuring Goku as a <a href="/wiki/West_City_Fire_Brigade" title="West City Fire Brigade">volunteer fire-fighter</a>.

<p>Goku has made guest appearances in various Japanese television shows and manga. He is a recurring character in the anime remake of another series by Toriyama, <i>Dr. Slump</i>. In 1990, Goku (in anime form) made a surprise 2 min.30 appearance on "Yamada Katsute Nai Wink" (やまだかつてないWink, "Yamada Katsute Nai Wink"). Here, he uses the Dragon Balls to help J-Pop star and hostess Kuniko Yamada gain her abilities, including the ability to execute a Kamehameha, which she playfully uses on him.

<p>Goku can also be considered a regular commodity for Fuji TV. In 2003, Goku would appear in the interactive feature entitled <i>Kyutai Panic Adventure!</i> (球体パニックアドベンチャー!, <i>Kyūtai Panikku Adobenchā!?</i>; lit. "Orb Panic Adventure!"), which was featured exclusively at the Fuji TV headquarters. Here, Frieza attacks tourists by blasting the orb section free it from the rest of the Fuji TV building followed by a cannon attack by Arlong and his gang.

<p>Goku has often been the subject of various parodies over the years. On an episode of Operation!, Takeshi Castle, which is currently known as in the US as MXC, had an episode called family day. In that episode, the hosts Beat Takeshi and Sonomanma Higashi were dressed as popular anime characters one was Kid Goku and the other was Doremon. In the MXC dub of that episode, when asked who about his Goku costume, the host replied "Who, me? I'm dressed as a crack head!" The <i><a href="/wiki/Shonen_Jump" title="Shonen Jump">Shonen Jump</a></i> "Gag Special 2005" issue released on December 1, 2004 featured a <i>Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo</i> one-shot <i>Dragon Ball</i> parody manga. The manga was a humorous retelling of the battle between Goku and Vegeta in the Saiyan Saga. Jelly Jiggler was Goku and Don Patch was Vegeta. In the anime episode "Fire It Up! Abenobashi Hong Kong Combat Shopping Arcade" of Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi, character Sasshi Imamiya goes Super Saiyan much like Goku and fires a Kamehameha. He and other various characters also appeared in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_Japan" title="History of Japan">History of Japan</a> that aired in Japan.

</p><p>Despite being originally based on and directly named after Sun Wukong from <i>Journey to the West</i>, Goku's background ended up evolving into something similar to Superman's origin story: they both were born on alien planets under different names (Kakarot and Kal-El); they both were sent to Earth as infants right before their home planets were destroyed, and they were both adopted by Earthlings and given new names (Goku and Clark Kent). Furthermore, both of their biological fathers (Bardock and Jor-El) tried to warn their people of their destruction. In the 133rd magazine edition (September 2002) of <i>Wizard</i>, a hypothetical Superman vs. Goku match-up was published. Goku won the fight quite easily, not even needing to use the Super Saiyan form. The article fell under heavy criticism by pop culture analysts, as it claimed that Superman would die from a fall from Earth's orbit despite him surviving far worse. Later that year, <i>Wizard</i> did an open poll at the Toronto Fan Expo and New York Comicon asking attendees who would win. Over 80% said Goku would defeat Superman. Rooster Teeth's Screwattack channel, as part of their <i>Death Battle </i>series, pits Goku against Superman twice, with Superman winning both rounds because as the characters said, Superman has no limits to his power in the first place whereas Goku can only break <i>his</i> limits.
</p><p>Goku has been the inspiration for many other manga/anime characters, including <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Luffy" class="extiw" title="w:c:onepiece:Luffy">Monkey D. Luffy</a> from the <i>One Piece</i> series, <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto" class="extiw" title="w:c:naruto:Naruto">Naruto Uzumaki</a> from the <i>Naruto</i> series, <a href="https://zatchbell.fandom.com/wiki/Zatch_Bell" class="extiw" title="w:c:zatchbell:Zatch Bell">Zatch Bell</a> from the <i>Zatch Bell</i> series, and most recently <a href="https://toriko.fandom.com/wiki/Toriko" class="extiw" title="w:c:toriko:Toriko">Toriko</a> from the <i>Toriko</i> series. The disbanded German rock band "Son Goku" takes their name from Goku. The band's frontman Thomas D specifically chose the name as Goku embodies the band's philosophy. Stating he was "fascinated by Goku's naïveté and cheerfulness, yet, at the same time, a great warrior saving the world".<sup id="cite_ref-munichx_238-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-munichx-238">&#91;238&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In homage to their role in voicing Goku, both Masako Nozawa and <a href="/wiki/Sean_Schemmel" title="Sean Schemmel">Sean Schemmel</a> (Goku's longest-serving English dub VA) have voiced versions of the original Sun Wukong. Nozawa voiced Wukong in <i>League of Legends</i>, and Schemmel (along with other language voice actors) voiced a version of the original Sun Wukong himself in <i>Smite</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Trivia">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul><li>In Japan, Goku is sometimes rendered as "Gokuh" or "Gokou" in promotional material such as toys and figures, mainly as a way to make him stand out from other Japanese adaptations from Sun Wukong. However, the latter spelling would make the pronunciation different from its intended one.</li>
<li>Comically, in <i>Dragon Ball</i>, Goku says he hates carrots (his namesake) when fighting against <a href="/wiki/Monster_Carrot" title="Monster Carrot">Monster Carrot</a>.</li>
<li>In the anime, Goku is shown to suffer from severe <span class="plainlinks"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trypanophobia">trypanophobia</a></span>, or the fear of needles.<sup id="cite_ref-DBZ74_137-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DBZ74-137">&#91;137&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Goku's hobbies include finding and fighting strong opponents.<sup id="cite_ref-SEG_4-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SEG-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Goku will eat anything.<sup id="cite_ref-SEG_4-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SEG-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Goku's favorite vehicle is the Flying Nimbus.<sup id="cite_ref-SEG_4-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SEG-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>From his mid-teens to early twenties, Goku was a famous celebrity on Earth for his defeat of <a href="/wiki/King_Piccolo" title="King Piccolo">King Piccolo</a> and his later victory over Piccolo Jr. at the 23rd World Tournament. Later, Goku appears to have been largely forgotten in favor of the following World Tournament champion, <a href="/wiki/Mr._Satan" title="Mr. Satan">Mr. Satan</a> (most likely due to Mr. Satan using success to become a rich and famous media hound in contrast to Goku living a humble and quiet life away from the public's eye). However sometime after the defeat of the <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Dragon" title="Shadow Dragon">Shadow Dragons</a> and before the 64th World Martial Arts Tournament, in <i>GT</i>, Goku is once again a revered hero as a giant statue of him is displayed in the stadium.<sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">&#91;242&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, though the general public may have forgotten his heroics, people like <a href="/wiki/King_Furry" title="King Furry">King Furry</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_Tournament_Announcer" title="World Tournament Announcer">World Tournament Announcer</a> do as they have witnessed to his exploits.</li>
<li>In the Japanese version, Goku's voice actress, Masako Nozawa, also voices every biological male relative of Goku, with the exception of Raditz.</li>
<li>In the anime version of the <a href="/wiki/Universe_Survival_Saga" title="Universe Survival Saga">Universe Survival Saga</a> Goku is seen as a villain by most of the other Universes due to his role in creating the Tournament of Power (although Goku's actions actually gave the universes with low mortal levels a chance to survive as Zeno was originally going to erase them all immediately).</li>
<li>Goku shares many similarities with Superman from DC Comics:
<ul><li>Both are human-like aliens who were sent to Earth before their planets were destroyed (Goku from Planet Vegeta and Superman from Planet Krypton) and spent their lives believing they were human until learning the truth as young adults. The difference was that Goku was sent to Earth to destroy it, while Superman was sent to Earth to live in and help it.</li>
<li>Both have alien names (Goku was Kakarot and Superman was Kal-El) they seldom go by.</li>
<li>Both are tall and muscular men with distinct black hair styles.</li>
<li>They both have gained the respect of gods and other such beings, such as Beerus and Whis for Goku and citizens of New Genesis and Themyscira for Superman.</li>
<li>They both have an Achilles' Heel: Goku's are his tail and hunger, while Superman's is Kryptonite and yellow sunlight depletion/red sunlight exposure.</li>
<li>Both can draw power from the sun: Superman subconsciously being empowered by exposure to its light and Goku to create the Spirit Bomb or (reflected off the moon) enter the Great Ape forms.</li>
<li>They both have flight, incredible super speed, extreme super strength, super senses, and can emit powerful blasts from their being.</li>
<li>Both have fought members of their race who are or were evil: Vegeta for Goku, and Zod for Superman.</li>
<li>They both have evil counterparts: Turles, Goku Black, and a <a href="/wiki/Clone_(FighterZ)" title="Clone (FighterZ)">clone</a> for Goku, and Ultraman, Bizarro, Cyborg Superman, H'El and Superboy-Prime for Superman.</li>
<li>They both have a married an Earth woman: Chi-Chi for Goku, and Lois Lane for Superman.</li>
<li>Both have half-human sons, Gohan and Goten for Goku, and Jonathan Kent for Superman, who have been implied to have the potential to be more powerful than their respective fathers.</li>
<li>Both had contact from their race through a blood relative (Raditz and Kara Zor-El).</li>
<li>Both have discovered that their race home planet was not completely wiped from existence (Universe 6 Saiyans and the Citizens of Kandor).</li>
<li>Both have fathers who foresaw the end of their home planet and attempted to save it (Bardock and Jor-El).</li>
<li>Both have also fought virtually unstoppable monsters from their home planet (Broly and Doomsday).</li>
<li>Both are pacifists by nature who refused to use more power than necessary to face a problem (albeit Goku also does this for the sake of a better challenge while Superman fears hurting others too much in general).</li>
<li>Both are considered the greatest champion of good for their people and known for their pure/noble views in life.</li>
<li>Due to all above statements, there are heavily conflicted debates among fans of both characters on who would win in the event of a full-on battle against each other.</li></ul></li>
<li>On one occasion, in an interview with <i>Shonen Jump</i> in 1995, Akira Toriyama stated that Goku is his favorite character from the series.<sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-243">&#91;243&#93;</a></sup> In previous statements, he claimed that Piccolo was his favorite, and before this, that Tien was his favorite.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Budokai_Tenkaichi_(series)" title="Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi (series)"><i>Raging Blast</i> series</a>, Goku is the only character to have three ultimate attacks, which can be changed through customization.</li>
<li>Goku is unusually light for his build; despite having a muscular physique, he is only 62kg (137 lbs) and given that his official height is also 175 cm (5'9"), this would put Goku's weight as approaching underweight.</li>
<li>In 2004, Goku was voted the top character in the series to the Japanese fans.<sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">&#91;244&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Goku having a Naruto Sage Mode costume in <i><a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z:_Battle_of_Z" title="Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z">Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z</a></i> is similar to how Naruto has Goku's <a href="/wiki/Turtle_School_uniform" class="mw-redirect" title="Turtle School uniform">Turtle School uniform</a> as a bonus costume in the 2013 video game <i>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3</i>; both costumes are based on an artwork featured in the <i>Naruto 10th Anniversary Special Fanbook 2</i>. Sage Goku performs his <a href="/wiki/Kamehameha" title="Kamehameha">Kamehameha</a> with a gesture similar to a jutsu attack from <i>Naruto</i> and runs with his arms stretched outside like the way <i>Naruto</i> characters run.
<ul><li>Additionally, canonically Goku himself is no stranger when it comes to Shurikenjutsu (which is often associated with Ninja in popular culture) as he was able to learn <a href="/wiki/Ninja_Murasaki" title="Ninja Murasaki">Ninja Murasaki</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Ninja_Mist_Shuriken" title="Ninja Mist Shuriken">Ninja Mist Shuriken</a> technique via <a href="/wiki/Mimicry" title="Mimicry">Mimicry</a> and then performed it himself by stealing some of Murasaki's shuriken during their battle in Muscle Tower.
<ul><li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Super_Dragon_Ball_Heroes:_World_Mission" title="Super Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission">Super Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission</a></i>, Ninja Mist Shuriken can be performed by Goku if the Ninja Mist Shuriken accessory is equipped to any non-Special Type Goku card in a custom deck (additionally it can also be equipped to a Custom Card through Card Creation). Goku performs this in the same manner as Ninja Murasaki does in <i>World Mission</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>In addition to his use of Shuriken jutsu and the Naruto Sage Mode costume, Goku also worn Shu's clothes (which is basically a Ninja Suit) after his clothes were destroyed by the <a href="/wiki/Pilaf_Machine" title="Pilaf Machine">Pilaf Machine</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Fortuneteller_Baba_Saga" title="Fortuneteller Baba Saga">Fortuneteller Baba Saga</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>In <i>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</i>, despite his adversarial relationship with Frieza, Goku will state he is jealous that the Future Warrior gets to train with him (if the warrior talks to him without selecting anything).</li></ul>
